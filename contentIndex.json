    "title": "Hello world!",
    "content": "\nHi there and thanks for signing up for my newsletter!\n\nI’ll try to keep these in a rough 3-2-1 fashion in each issue, with 3 things I’ve found interesting from others, 2 things I’ve been wondering about, and 1 thing I’ve done.\n\n## 3 things I’ve found interesting\n\n1. Found out about [100 Rabbits](https://100r.co/site/about_us.html), a tag-team of two people sailing around the world making open-source software\n2. OpenAIs recent work with [DALL-E](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/) and [CLIP](https://openai.com/blog/clip/). Some really revolutionary stuff in combining text and image domains.\n3. Vlogbrothers on [How To Change What you Want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salgtCpST3A). Interesting video on how content we consume steers our wants and what we want to want affects our actual wants. Hank says it in a way that makes a lot more sense so give it a watch.\n\n## 2 things I’ve been wondering about\n\n1. Why didn’t I start writing earlier? Writing has always been a way to help me organize my own thoughts. Now that I’ve started writing more frequently, I feel like I’m able to better put the jumble of thoughts inside my brain onto paper (or I guess a Markdown file in this case).\n2. Promoting healthier [hacking culture](/thoughts/hackathons). Conversation inspired by [this tweet](https://twitter.com/sarahbdhsn/status/1347666496718213120). What can we do as hackathon organizers to make events less stressful/hypercompetitive for attendees (especially those who are differently-abled)?\n\n## 1 thing I’ve done\n\nI wrote a [reflection piece about my 2020](/posts/2020) as well as set some goals for the upcoming year! A few interesting tidbits on paratelic vs telic goal setting.",

    "title": "A request for coffee chats",
    "content": "\nThis month of January went by with blazing speed. I can't say if it's because of school starting back up or just the massive amounts of s t u f f going on in the world right now. \n\nOn an unrelated note, I'm currently working on stepping outside my comfort zone and meeting new people so feel free to email back if you'd be interested in a coffee chat! I'd be happy to learn about all the cool things y'all are working on :)\n\n## 3 things I’ve found interesting\n\n1. [Velocity vs Acceleration based execution](https://www.samsonzhang.com/2021/01/19/how-to-innovate-and-create-a-culture-of-innovation.html). Insightful read on how orgs can be [moving fast but not be innovating](thoughts/move%20fast%20and%20break%20things.md). How do we have a high acceleration org rather than just a high velocity one?\n2. [Switch Transformers: Larger than GPT-3](https://venturebeat.com/2021/01/12/google-trained-a-trillion-parameter-ai-language-model).  An interesting approach to deal with huge language models by 'sparsly' activating certain subsets of the network. Interesting to see modern ML techniques going back to expert systems of the early 90's.\n3. [Suspension of Internet in Uganda](https://blog.cloudflare.com/uganda-january-13-2021-internet-shut-down/). During an election at that. Curious how something of this scale was orchestrated, let alone agreed to. Something that feels so close to [infrastructure](/thoughts/infrastructure) shouldn't be freely shutdown so easily.\n\n## 2 things I’ve been wondering about\n\n1. How can we make policy more accessible? Idea has been festering in my head after reading Eva Zhang's post on '[Request for Startups](https://evaz.substack.com/p/rfs)'. Is there a better way we can track what policy makers are up to during non-election years? Maybe some sort of data mesh or platform that simplifies policy or makes it easier to view updates? Decided to take a stab at this problem during HTN2020++ this year. [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/legist).\n2. Digital Gardening. After reading Joel Hook's blog post on his own [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden), I've been thinking and reflecting on my own processes for managing my garden. It's culminated into a blog post which you can read [here](/posts/digital-gardening).\n\n## 1 thing I’ve done\nI presented a technical workshop for the first time at Hack the North 2020++! I've always been a little spooked of public speaking but it was really empowering to be able to go up in front of so many people (albeit virtually) and talk about something I'm passionate about. My workshop was on a gentle introduction to Docker and you can view the recording [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONNQ5EDhXUk) (it's not a Rick Roll, I promise).\n\n",

    "title": "Spider-man neurons, hearing fractals, and fulfilment",
    "content": "\nI can't believe we're approaching a time of year when I can wait until *after* dinner to turn on my desk light. In the almost two months since my last newsletter, I've been doing a lot of [reading](/books), having 1:1s with some pretty rad people, [learning Rust](https://github.com/jackyzha0/rs-openai/), and of course surviving school. Surviving, in this case, is a questionable word choice.\n\n## 3 things I’ve found interesting\n\n1. [Multimodal Neurons in Neural Networks](https://openai.com/blog/multimodal-neurons/). First off, Spider-Man neuron. This paper is an interesting exploration on how neural networks can appear to have an understanding of abstract higher-level concepts that are *composable*. A lot of really interesting potential here.\n2. [Sounds of the Mandelbrot Set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiAj9WW1OfQ). Is mayonaisse an instrument? Yes, and fractals are too. A really cool look into doing an auditory visualization of things we wouldn't normally associate with sound.\n3. [Jazz Messages](https://jazzkeys.plan8.co/?msg=-MVYtMespmT9iNLyKnqO). Send notes to your friends in style with **j a z z**.\n\n## 2 things I’ve been wondering about\n\n1. What does it mean to find fulfilment in what you do? I've found myself involved with an overabundance of projects in the past year and only a select handful have truly been fulfilling to work on. I'm doing a bit of introspection in hopes of maybe figuring out why I love doing the things I love and maybe an answer to who I am.\n2. [What's not in the frame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRZuEGuU_es). In which Hank talks about the [metaphorical 'frame'](posts/context-collapse.md), or the context in which people present themselves. People choose to present themselves a certain way in front of others and in doing so, leave a lot of what's *actually* going on outside the frame. If all we ever see are other people's frames, how do we remind ourselves of what's going on outside of it and normalize being 'out-of-frame'?\n\n## 1 thing I’ve done\nPretty slow month in terms of personal projects/pieces, mostly either working on patching up older projects (finally got around to updating [Docker Explained](https://github.com/jackyzha0/docker-explained)). I did end up finishing Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software by Nadia Eghbal and found some really interesting ideas that I wanted to explore and flesh out a bit. I had a few convos with a friend on Twitter and ended up writing a piece on [why Open Source should be funded](posts/paid-open-source.md).\n\nStay tuned for next month(s) and don't forget to be awesome :)",

    "title": "Sun sneezing, infrastructure moderation, and why bikes are better than tricycles",
    "content": "\nHello there and welcome back to another issue of some mildly coherent ramblings. It's been yet another couple busy weeks, but I've just wrapped up my second decade on this crazy planet! I have a lot of really exciting life updates that I want to share with all of you soon, but without further ado: the content you subscribed for.\n\n## 3 things I’ve found interesting\n\n1. [Context Collapse](https://www.rewire.org/context-collapse-online/). Follow up to last issue's ['What's not in the frame'](posts/context-collapse.md) question, I was finally able to put a name to a concept I've had floating around! The TLDR is the experience when all your different personalities or frames from different contexts (e.g. work, friend group, family) all intermingle. In a place where so many of your social groups intersect, it becomes difficult to decide how to behave or 'be yourself'.\n2. [Emergent Behaviour and Cellular Automata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-iSQQgOd1A). Mesmerizing video by [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/user/Cercopithecan) on [how complex (and beautiful) behaviour can arise out of simple rules.](thoughts/emergent%20behaviour.md) I've been wanting to get into experimenting with shaders and graphics stuff and this *might* just be the slight nudge I needed.\n3. [Sun Sneezing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69XZJ9DEj0). When people ask me what I'm allergic to, my two answers are 1) pollen and 2) the sun. Yes, I sneeze when I look at the sun.\n\n## 2 things I’ve been wondering about\n\n1. [Moderation in Infrastructure](https://stratechery.com/2021/moderation-in-infrastructure/). I've been thinking a lot about [infrastructure](/thoughts/infrastructure). How do we draw the line between an end product and infrastructure? How should infrastructure regulate usage on its platform (if at all)? Been thinking about AWS's decision to remove Parler recently and whether it was warranted for AWS to do so. At what level of infrastructure should something become a '[public good](thoughts/public%20goods.md)'? As more and more of our digital infrastructure is built out under private companies, does it change how we govern content on top of it?\n2. [Are 'easy-to-use' products always better?](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/348/000/) Interesting read about the 'seductive, destructive appeal of ease of use': the belief that \"ease of use\" is somehow conflated with better products. I always hear that complex tools and apps being not implemented because user research proved that it was 'too difficult to use' but is this costing us in the long run? One great example the article talks about is the tricycle/bicycle analogy. \"It is clear that for an unskilled user, the tricycle is much easier to use. But, as we know, the payoff from investing in learning to ride on two wheels is enormous.\" Related: [building tools around workflows](thoughts/workflows.md)\n\n## 1 thing I’ve done\n\nI spent some time last weekend rewriting the frontend of [ctrl-v](http://ctrl-v.app/), my open-source Pastebin clone to use Next.js instead of React + React Router! Wrote up a blog post on my process here: [https://blog.jzhao.xyz/posts/ctrlv-next/](/posts/ctrlv-next). The weather has been nice in Vancouver the past couple of days so I've had the chance to just go outside and read in a park which has been a really nice change of pace from my usual go-go-go-get-shit-done daily schedule. Looking forward to finishing up this semester, I have a lot of really cool projects I want to work in the next month and a bit!\n\nUntil next time, don't forget to be awesome :)",

    "title": "The bookstore with a single book, knowledge distillation, and tight feedback loops",
    "content": "\nI am writing this newsletter edition as NYC is being bombarded by hail. The sounds of little balls of ice ricocheting off of the roof has a sort of din to it that feels oddly comforting? In any case, your (bi) monthly dose of links from yours truly:\n\n## 3 things I’ve found interesting\n\n1. [The bookstore with a single book.](https://www.takram.com/projects/a-single-room-with-a-single-book-morioka-shoten/) This is a tiny bookstore in Tokyo that sells a single book at a time in a small room. I really love the emphasis on getting to know a single book and author intimately -- especially in an age of [digital consumerism](thoughts/attention%20economy.md).\n2. [Beware of tight feedback loops.](https://brianlui.dog/2020/05/10/beware-of-tight-feedback-loops/) I've always believed that rapid [feedback](thoughts/feedback%20loops.md) is always necessarily good. Yet, Brian warns about relying too much on these tight feedback loops -- feedback in life is almost always noisy. Only focusing on rapid feedback can lead one to ignore the larger scale trends.\n3. [Why Algorithmic Systems Create Absurd Outcomes](https://ali-alkhatib.com/papers/chi/utopia/utopia.pdf) (or if you prefer the [video version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KLAa62h1E0). Loved how accessible this paper/video was in explaining some pretty complex topics. I've often found myself having trouble putting into words why 'big tech' and monopolies in general are bad other than the generic \"we need competition for innovation\" excuse and this humanistic approach really resonated with me.\n\n## 2 things I’ve been wondering about\n\n1. [The role of knowledge distillation.](https://distill.pub/2017/research-debt/) After finishing *The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software*, I have been seeing parallels between software maintenance and systems of knowledge. So much emphasis nowadays is on creation rather than maintenance; it would be interesting to see if we can shift the emphasis from creation of new knowledge to maintenance of existing knowledge. I think there's lots of work that can be done to improve how we go about [distillation of knowledge](thoughts/knowledge%20distillation.md) through teaching and giving children agency to explore ideas (more on this in *Mindstorms*).\n2. [The double bind of developing tech.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collingridge_dilemma) Still trying to wrap my head fully around this idea, but the main gist is that there are two opposing facts that seem to make developing tech ethically very difficult. The first is that it's hard to figure out what impact technology will make until *after* one develops and releases it to the public to use. The second is that regulating and/or changing technology is extremely difficult after the technology becomes entrenched within society. No thoughts on this yet, but just wondering if there's any way to get out of this [double-bind](thoughts/catch%2022.md) (or at least productively avoid it).\n\n## 1 thing I’ve done\nLots of change in my personal life too! I finally worked up the courage to cut out a few commitments from my life in an effort to reclaim some time to just explore some ideas I have + enjoy life in NYC :') Reach out if you're around!",

    "title": "2020: An Imperfect Palindrome",
    "content": "\n## A year of 'almosts'\n2020 is:\n* about 9.5 times longer than a Rick Roll in seconds\n* about 54 times longer than the number of minutes I listened to Spotify this year\n* about how many contributions I made on GitHub this year\n* roughly the amount of pages I've read this year\n* almost a palindrome\n\nNow there's nothing super fascinating about almost-palindromes but it is also very fitting given the number of 'almosts' in my year. Here's an imperfect recollection of what I've been up to this year.\n\n### nwPlus\nI help to do event logistics at nwPlus! This year, Allison and Anne somehow convinced me to take on a director role for HackCamp (or what was previously known as UBC Local Hack Day). \n\nTo be completely frank, I had no clue what that really entailed and jumped into it head-first. Along the way, I struggled with figuring out how to effectively lead a team of 4 older teammates, balancing nwPlus with all my other commitments, and being confident in my work as director. We had a bunch of logistical wrenches thrown our way, from figuring out how to bring our hackathon to the virtual stage to and navigating an entire event rebrand. It was honestly amazing to have even been able to hold the event at all, let alone attract over 900+ registrations, 500+ attendees, 3.2k+ livestream viewers, and $1200 in donations to charities. To say I was completely blown away by the turnout would be a massive understatement. We didn't get to hold the in-person event we were hoping for, but the next-best thing was almost just as good.\n\n![Post-HackCamp feels](/posts/images/2020/post-hc.png)*Post-HackCamp Feels*\n\n### A poorly played game of Tetris\nDue to a combination of poor planning, luck, and FOMO, I made the poor decision to take on an internship at Hootsuite along with the open-source fellowship at MLH, all the while trying to juggle my mental sanity and health. Spoiler alert: it was a bad idea.\n\nMy calendar ended up looking a lot like a poorly played game of Tetris as I tried to stack hackathon onto after-work social onto tech talk. Unfortunately in this version of Tetris, there was no line clearing when I fully packed a week. You don't need more than two braincells to realize that a schedule like that just isn't sustainable. I was often working upwards of 80+ hours a week and I felt like death reincarnate. I think the lowest point of the summer was sitting on the couch after working an 8 hour day at Hootsuite followed by another 6 hours on fellowship things and realizing that I only had oatmeal in the morning. \"I should learn to play the ukelele.\"\n\nIn order to get through the summer, I had to develop healthier coping methods to deal with the stress, anxiety, and general lack-of-time-to-do-anything that came along with it. Though I by no means have claimed to have solved any of these things, I've found a few things to be really helpful in maintaining some semblance of mental sanity:\n\n1. **Time Blocking** -- COVID had eliminated any physical boundaries I already had; no 15 minute transit to separate work and home, no physical walk required to go from home to school. As a result, everything started to meld together. If it only takes me 3 clicks to go from my club meeting to my work tickets, I can just work just a little longer, right? I found that time blocking really let me regain a little bit of control back in my life. I could tell myself to only spend *x* hours doing *y*. It had the added benefit of allowing me to *actually block off time for myself* and to enjoy life a little bit.\n2. **Exercise** -- although I've known this fact for a while now, this is the year I've really decided to actually apply it to my life. Feeling like garbage? Go for a run to feel more like garbage for a good hour before feeling better! I've had the privilege of being really close to nature so I get to enjoy the subtle crunching of leaves and brisk autumn air with each step.\n3. **Quality time with quality people** -- 2020 was not a kind year to most, myself included and I'm not going to pretend otherwise. However, the presence of a select few individuals in my life really helped to make the year slightly less of a dumpster fire. You know who you are :')\n\n### Independent living\nI finally moved out from on-campus housing into my own place! I've definitely felt tinges of loneliness during the pandemic but I've learned to fill the silence with music, podcasts, reading, or questionable arts and crafts. I've also somehow managed to get by the past few months without giving myself food poisoning in my transition from campus food to homecooked food.\n\nNo fancy photos here but enjoy a few pictures of my workspace and the view from my balcony.\n\n![Home sweet 127.0.0.1](/posts/images/2020/home.png)*Home sweet 127.0.0.1*\n\n## An imperfect retrospective\nIt would be sort of naive to try to list out everything that went well/didn't go well this year. Too much happened this year to fully give each bit of my year the respect it deserves, so in the spirit of this 'almost' year, enjoy this 'almost' retrospective.\n\n### Things that sparked joy\n- **Surrounding myself with genuine people who care.**\n- **Picking up old hobbies and books** -- Heraclitus said, \"No man steps in the same river twice.\" The second time around, both man and river are different than they were before. The paints and books are the same, but we change between reads and brushstrokes. The world changes, too. I've found it really rewarding to be able to pick up old hobbies like watercolour, crocheting, and [reading](/thoughts/reading) and discover it for the second time.\n- **Exercising more and enjoying nature** -- not everyday you get to read during sunset at the top of a peak with some of your closest friends.\n### Things that didn't spark to joy\n- **Learning to block out time better** -- although I did improve on this, I've definitely told myself \"ah, another few hours couldn't hurt\" far too many times this year. I need to work on prioritizing my time more and saying no to things.\n- **Balancing intake and output** -- How does one balance learning/intake of information intake with processing and thinking about that information? This year felt like trying to drink information through a firehose and spitting it right back out using a paper straw. I'm trying to work on better processes for choosing what information to explore more and to spend more time thinking and marinating thoughts (see: [exploit explore](thoughts/exploit%20explore.md) tradeoff). [Tweet.](https://twitter.com/_jzhao/status/1328399991950307328)\n\n## Goal setting\nWhen [[thoughts/writing|writing]] up the first few drafts for this post, I realized that just having goals with cold hard numbers on them without any motivating reason feels very empty. I'm not setting these goals just to achieve some number, but rather to enjoy the act of doing it or to develop a habit. I had a conversation with [Emre](https://twitter.com/AlcaEmre) about this and he brought up Reversal Theory as a way to understand our motivations and goals. In particular, one of the four domains of Reversal Theory is the means-ends domain. Motivations in this domain lie somewhere on the telic to paratelic action scale.\n\n**Telic Actions** are more serious in nature, motivated by wanting to achieve something or reach a goal. This would be like writing an essay to get a good mark. Most telic actions are a means to an end rather than the actual end themselves.\n\n**Paratelic Actions** are more [playful](thoughts/play.md) in nature and involve enjoying the process in the moment. This is more akin to reading for enjoyment and for the pleasure of learning. Hopefully, these are the actual end goals that telic actions will help achieve. With that in mind, here are my 2021 goals!\n### Paratelic Goals\n- Acknowledging my privilege and use it to help those who are less fortunate\n- Have impact with my work, whether that be through writing, projects, or just conversations\n- Lead a more physically healthy lifestyle\n- Learn more about the world through a [feedback loops](thoughts/feedback%20loops.md) of reading, writing, and talking to people\n\n### Telic Goals\n- Donate 5% of pre-tax income to charity\n- Reach 50k people through projects and blog posts\n- Read 10 books\n- Set aside 10 hours a week for personal projects, learning, and writing\n- Be able to run from my apartment to Stanley Park and back (~10km) in one go\n- Have 1:1s with 50 new people in 2021\n\nI've been waiting almost 2 years to say this pun but,\n\n\u003e hindsight is 2020.\n\n(no I didn't plan on releasing this right at midnight, I just take a long time to write)",

    "content": "\n\u003e Have you been writing those letters to yourself?\n\u003e \"Dear Evan Hansen, This is gonna be a good day and here’s why.\"\n\nThis post comes to you in 3 parts: a letter to my past self, a reflection on goals, and a letter to my future self.\n\nOne reminiscent and nostalgic, one a neutral review, and the last a brutally honest dump of aspirations and feelings.\n\n---\n\n*To my 2021 self,*\n\nLittle do you know you'll start off the year making a charcuterie board of tofu, snowshoe trips with friends, and making a masking tape Christmas tree that still stands to this day.\n\n![](/thoughts/images/2021-collage-1.png)\n\nMaybe not the most usual start to a year but fitting considering the year that is ahead of you.\n\nYou tried lots of new things! Some you liked and some you didn't. It was full of meeting lots of really wonderful new people, [[thoughts/writing|writing]] lots, reading lots, getting incredibly digital-garden-pilled, and (admittedly) being on Twitter a bit too much. \n\nYou learned how to drive, maybe a few years later than usual, but hey you got it done. Not many people may trust your driving skills from New York but that's reasonable given the only thing between you and a license was a 7-minute long stroll down the road. In learning to drive, you spent some extended time with the family for the first time in a while and all of the pains and joys that brings.\n\nAnd maybe the most surprising of them all, you decided to say 'fuck it' and decided to move to a co-living house with 15 other people in New York for the summer. Let's just say you learned the importance of personal time pretty quickly. Yet, amidst the hustle-and-bustle of the millions in New York, you were able to find solace in the [books](/books), the parks, and the few close friends made. There is a really nice bench near the Guggenheim under a blooming Crabapple tree that sags *just* the right amount to be extra comfortable. I suggest bringing some nice bread and a book to spend a few afternoons here and really just bask in its serenity.\n\n![](/thoughts/images/2021-collage-2.png)\n\nLuckily, COVID calmed down enough in the second half of 2021 to be able to see old classmates again in-person for the first time. Being able to laugh at dumb jokes in the same room or just working in amiable silence may feel quite distant but I assure you it will happen and it will be just as good as you remembered it being.\n\nYou had cozy picnic dates, 20-person AirBnB rentals on Victoria Island, and a crazy hackathon all the way down in Austin, Texas. You and Anson finally celebrated your first anniversary together and, lo and behold, got each other the exact same thing. Disgustingly cheesy, you two.\n\n![](/thoughts/images/2021-collage-3.png)\n\nTo summarize, this was a year of understanding yourself and opening up to the world. You learned that, maybe, it wasn't so bad to be vulnerable and to express yourself in full to the people around you. You learned the joys of meeting wonderfully passionate people who talk about their craft with stars in their eyes and the deep gratitude of getting to more fully know the people you choose to surround yourself with.\n\nThe biggest part of this year were the friends and loved ones that stuck with me through the best and worst of it.\n\n\u003e \"Who are the people, ideas, and books that magnify your spirit? Find them, hold on to them, and visit them often.\" -- Maria Popova\n\nI hope you cherish these people and make sure they know just how much they are appreciated, and excited for you to live this year like I did.\n\nKindly,\n*Your present self*\n\n---\n\nI set a few goals at the end of my [last end-of-year reflection](posts/2020.md).\n\n- Donate 5% of pre-tax income to charity\n\t- I made a total pre-tax income of around ~30k and total donation amount tallying up to 2.2k to Project for Awesome, Asian Mental Health, Nonprofit Foundation, Heart and Stroke Foundation, and bootstrapping for the reflect apprenticeship.\n\t- There were a few times this year I felt stretched thin financially due to lack of financial planning. I don't regret giving though. I love giving in a way that feels local and impactful. I would be interested in expanding this to start a mini grants program using [Moth Minds](https://www.mothminds.com/) or something, but this would involve first improving my own financial management and budgeting :))\n- Reach 50k people through projects and blog posts\n\t- Done! Surprisingly prolific year in terms of [projects](thoughts/Projects.md) and writing. Got really into digital gardening and CLIs for a bit over the summer and even ended up doing a few [workshops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PFXBpJjjoc) too. Happy with the amount of technical growth that happened this year.\n\t- As a side note, it's been so so cool watching a little community grow around [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/network/members) and all the different types of people from all around the world giving it a chance to be a part of their daily workflow. (And all the growing pains that come along with open-source maintenance and community management)\n- Read 10 books\n\t- Actually pretty proud of this one! Not just because I crushed the number (18 whole books!! A whole 3x more than last year) but I felt like I had a really good diet of the different types of content I was consuming. Did a lot of online link collecting and book reading of both fiction and non-fiction. I found out that I surprisingly liked both dense academic text as well as soft scifi. I love the nuance and depth of takes that longer texts afford as well as the elaborate and at times poetic world building that happens in heavier fiction reads. I always remember reading under the covers with a flashlight because I wanted to finish the last book in a trilogy but lost that itch quite a while ago. Missing your bus stop because a chapter was just so good is not quite the same but close.\n- Set aside 10 hours a week for personal projects, learning, and writing\n\t- One particularly hard week in March ruined this streak unfortunately :((\n\t- Otherwise, I would consider this a success! This year, I had the wonderful chance of meeting some people who don't make me feel ashamed of but genuinely excited about niche [interaction design](thoughts/interaction%20design.md) reads, weirdly technical blogs, and [digital gardening](posts/networked-thought.md).\n\t- I feel like I finally have a group of people to just 'nerd snipe' each other and be ok with just sharing cool things I am working on. Eternally grateful to [curius.app](https://curius.app/), the whole gang at @verses, and the whole 'snipe city' group chat.\n- Be able to run from my apartment to Stanley Park and back (~10km) in one go\n\t- Sadly, the one actual physical goal I had I did not meet. In reality, I didn't take as good care of my body as I would've liked, often skimping on meals to get just a little bit more done.\n\t- I often blamed my weird class schedule for my lack of consistent physical activity this term but I know that that is no real excuse. I'm going to do better on this next year.\n- Have 1:1s with 50 new people in 2021\n\t- This is a goal that actually really surprised me as to how easy it became. When setting it, I surely thought that if there was one goal in this list I wouldn't meet, it would be this one. \n\t- At the start of last year, meeting people was not something I generally looked forward to. Yet, I found myself actually really enjoying each conversation after a while. Each call and meeting was a chance to quickly glimpse into the life of another, an offering of their incredibly valuable time in order to just *talk.*\n\t- To all 56 who offered just a little bit of your time to talk, I thank you. Many of my thoughts build off of our conversations and I am forever grateful for your thought-gifts.\n\n---\n\n*To my future self,*\n\nI am writing to you with the highs of new years optimism wearing off. *'Tis the time of new years resolutions!*\n\nMaybe it's the residual headache from the booster shot speaking or maybe its just me being a little tired but I hope you are doing well. More than anything I hope you are taking good care of yourself.\n\nI've never really written a letter to my self before, let alone one to my future self. I'm not quite sure what the tone of this piece is and quite certain that you will look back on this and laugh a little and just how bad it is.\n\nTo be honest, I know I've been saying that I'm working on being candidly excited about everything but I'm a little scared about the future.\n\nI care a lot about the people around me right now. These are an absolutely wonderful group of people who care about the world, endlessly curious, and inspire me to be better people. Yet it seems that everyone is headed in slightly different directions. I don't want to lose these people to a few measly miles and timezones. I really hope that, despite life choosing to move us in different paths physically, we'll be able to consciously choose to band together and stay close.\n\nI know it would be unreasonable to set super concrete goals given the whole *waves hand*. So I leave you not with a list of goals that I hope you will have accomplished, but a list of qualities I hope you'll have grown into.\n\n![My long term Bento](/thoughts/images/long%20term%20bento.png)*My long term [Bento](https://bentoism.org/)*\n\nI recently found out about the philosophy of [Bentoism](thoughts/Bentoism.md), a way of planning with a wider view of interests than just what we want right now, like our future selves, the people we care about, and the future of our children.\n\nI really like this way of thinking about self-interest as not just our current selves but as a community that spans across time. I've been thinking a lot about about what long-term success for me would look like. I don't think I've settled on anything concrete but there are certain aesthetics I would like it to embody:\n\n- I would like to be emotionally and physically well. I would like to be able to reach deep focus in whatever work I do and have the resources to be able to choose the work I find enjoyable.\n- I would like to be a great friend, family member, partner, and community member. I want to have the bandwidth to be generous to the people around me and the clarity to prioritize the important people in my life.\n- I want to be authentic and unabashedly excited about the world. I want to be able to help others create spaces of [local abundance](thoughts/play.md).\n- I hope you are ambitious in your dreams, projects, and [[thoughts/writing|writing]]. I want to embody a sort of [quiet confidence](https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/quiet-confidence/) in my own abilities and interests.\n- I hope you are steadfast in the values you believe in, cherish the people around you, and grow into the person you've been wanting to become.\n\nTo concretize, I hope you end each day saying you've embodied these:\n- If it's not a FUCK YES, it's a no. We are not half-assing anything in 2022\n- Eat well, sleep consistently, and exercise often\n- Be intentional about the people you care about\n\nI hope you are honest with yourself. Be kind.\n\nKindly,\n*Your present self*",

Of so much chaos in the world, the constancy of the ocean and its rises and falls gives me comfort.\n\n*You sound quite melancholic. Is everything alright?*\n\n... I've been thinking about the concept of commitment and trust. And maybe a bit about belonging too.\n\n*Can I lend an ear or a shoulder? We can just sit in the sun in quiet if you'd like.*\n\nThank you.\n\n**[And they sat there for a while. The sun inched downwards, setting the sky ablaze.]**\n\nWhat do you think it means to take on an identity?\n\n*Hmm. I think there is an element of trust -- that the ground below them will hold, that tomorrow will come again, and that the ocean will continue to rise and fall. Trust is an unquestioning attitude, an absence of deliberation over reliability. To commit is to believe it as a truth about oneself.*\n\nDo you think identities can change with time?\n\n*Yes. I don't think truth is absolute -- I think truth is a function of identity and identity itself is a function of time. Maybe, at this slice in time, certain axioms hold true about the universe. A few hours, years, millennia might pass and those truths might be different. Our different selves can choose between different systems of meaning and sense as our basic axioms.*\n\nI think my sense of self is undergoing a shift. It feels very liquid right now. One supposedly is supposed to 'live in the present' to enjoy the tea[^2], but I can't help but feel... scattered. I feel like I am trying to live too many lives at once and I feel the very fabric of my being being tugged at the seams. \n\n*I think empathy is a means of time dilation. For one to slow down or speed up their rate of life to match another. Of course, to constantly time travel to bridge the worlds of slow and fast is incredibly tiring. You must be very worn.*\n\nI want to be whole again. I want to be able to pour my everything in one life and to live that life well.\n\n*I understand. What is stopping you?*\n\nWell. What does it mean to responsible to a commitment that a past self has made? I promised [x] to some people very dear to me. At the time, it very much felt like the right thing to promise. I think my selves have changed though. The me that used to really enjoy [x] doesn't get that same spark, that same excitement as it used to. I found [y] pretty recently, and it gives me so much life to put time aside to work on it. Yet, I feel guilty. I made a commitment. A promise. It feels selfish to go back on that. I want to be someone who is reliable -- someone people can depend on and trust unquestioningly.\n\n*Ah yes, the desire to be a constant in the lives of others, yet to be fluid and growing in the life of your own. It is an unfortunate truth in life that we rarely get to choose both.*\n\nIs is possible? With all the time flowing through my hands, I am afraid that I am reaching for too much and end up not catching any at all.\n\n*Well let's see. What do you like so much about [y]?*\n\nI think recently, I've been able to better articulate the questions I want to spend my life answering. I think I've grown as a person and [y] aligns much more with what I want in the future, both in terms of myself and and the people I surround myself with. [x] feels like the trappings of the past, the remnants of a self I'm not sure I still consider my own. Yet, I am scared to let go of [x].\n\n*I think you are still muddled. I think what you lack is self-belief. The people in [y] inspire you, they amaze you. They have a ceiling of self-belief so high that it raises yours just through osmosis. These people are flawed too. They come from histories of [x], yet they still believe in themselves and what they want. Surround yourself with people in [y], for they are free in ways you're not[^3]. They are playing an infinite game in the hopes of waking you from the finite one you play in.*\n\nWhat shall I do?\n\n**[Both held their palms up to sunset.]**\n\n*Even if it is not your ideal life, you can always choose it. No matter what your life is, choosing it changes everything. I think you need to work on transitioning out of doing [x]. The self that committed to doing [x] has moved on. The self that is here and present needs to deal with the consequences of the past, but is not a slave to it. How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives[^1]. What we do with this hour and that one is what we are doing. What can you do to make your days meaningful? I think [y].*\n\n**[The two sat in silence, their silhouettes indistinguishable in the fading sunlight.]**\n\nThank you for your company, your space, and your time. I want to take the necessary time to ease out of [x] and to do it with care and tenderness.\n\n*You and me, we are not so different. One of us might be a few chapters ahead, but you'll be back at this beach someday. I'll be going now. See you soon.*\n\n*Yes, I hope so.*\n\n**[And the waves continued to crash down. One got up to leave, another came to sit down.]**\n\nThe sound of the waves are nice, huh?\n\n*Yeah.*\n\n[^1]: Annie Dillard, *The Writing Life*\n[^2]: Thich Nhat Hanh's *Tea Meditation*\n[^3]: Patricia Mou, *[Rabbit Holes](https://wellnesswisdom.substack.com/p/-wellness-wisdom-vol45-30-pieces)*",

    "title": "A Failure Resume",
    "content": "\nImposter Syndrome has been hitting really hard lately. Sometimes, it makes me feel like I don't deserve a lot of my current accomplishments and that I need to work even harder just to feel like I deserve what I have right now. I came across the concept of a **failure resume**[^1] a while ago. It's a list of things that didn't exactly go according to plan, and the lessons learned.\n\nThe more I think about it, the more I realize that a failure resume is a great way to document all the spectacular ways you've worked hard towards your own goals and accomplishments. In some ways, it validates your struggle and your effort.\n\nI've recently been inspired by both Kate Huang[^2] and Joice Tang's[^3] failure resumes and decided to make my own. What I wanted to try with this failure resume is, rather than focusing on the individual failures themselves, note what I learned from each of them. Hopefully, it'll serve as a powerful reminder to myself of how much I've struggled to get to where I am and why I deserve to be here. And more importantly, it serves as a place to reflect and learn from the past and be less scared of failure in the future.\n\n*A 2021 update:* Keeping a failure resume has let me be so much more ambitious in trying new things and applying for things I would otherwise think I'm unqualified to apply for! I'm really glad I started this.\n\nNow with all that stuff out of the way, here's the juicy list you've been waiting for:\n\n## 2021\n\n* Stopped sending out newsletter issues :(( Ended up focusing more on longer form [[thoughts/writing|writing]] instead\n\n* Ghosted by both Contrary Build and Contrary Fellowship\n\n* Couldn't work up the courage to apply to the [Maintainers Summer Fellowship](https://themaintainers.org/summer-fellow)\n\t* I really love the work that the Maintainers org is doing and this internship would have combined so many things that I'm interested in and passionate about: maintenance, writing, software, infrastructure, etc. I just couldn't convince myself that I wouldn't have made a fool of myself by applying :(\n\n* Had to cut out a bunch of commitments in order to maintain mental sanity\n  * While this isn't a 'failure' in the traditional sense, it was a failure for me in terms of setting good boundaries for myself. I had been spending way too much of my 'free' time working for projects and commitments I wasn't 100% interested in. I missed being able to just dedicate an afternoon to tinkering and exploring an idea so I decided to make the leap and cut down on commitments. **If it's not a hell yes, it's a no.**\n\n* Rejected from the Delta Fellowship\n\n* Rejected from ZFellows after they reached out to 'learn more' about my idea\n  \n* Rejected from the Y. P. Heung Foundation Award\n  * This scholarship is awarded to someone who demonstrates outstanding academic performance and is involved with community activities. I thought that, despite my slightly-above-average grades, I had a decent shot at this award given my involvement with the CS community at UBC but things didn't turn out the way I wanted. This award would've helped alleviate the financial stress that comes with having to pay tuition out-of-pocket, so I'll need to work a bit more for that money.\n\n## 2020\n\n* Rejected from an undergraduate TA position for a CS course\n  * I really wanted to give TA-ing a shot, especially after hearing almost all friends' positive experiences with it, so I decided to apply to TA a class I had done well in. It was a good reality check to realize that there's more to being a TA than just good grades and the title. Next time I apply, I'll find a course that I'm really passionate about and get to know the prof better.\n\n* Didn't finish 3 of the projects I wanted to finish over the summer\n  * I think I really just tried to commit to too many things this summer and spread myself really thin \u0026mdash; I'm still working on learning how to say no!\n\n* Ghosted by a professor for an undergrad research position\n\n* Rejected from a lot of grants and incubator programs for reflect\n  * We took the shotgun approach by applying to as many grants as possible but ended up realizing that were just applying to grants for the sake of applying, rather than having a good reason for why. It was a really good catalyst to reflect (pun intended) on what we wanted reflect to be and what direction to take it in the future.\n\n* Rejected by DeepMind (and 67 of the 70 companies I applied to)\n  * This position rejection hurt more than most \u0026mdash; even if it was swift and abrupt. DeepMind is a company that has played a huge part in shaping my interest of the intersection of machine learning, ethics, and philosophy, so you can imagine that the rejection email was not a pleasant sight to see in my inbox.\n\n## 2019\n\n* Rejected by 46 of the 47 companies I applied to\n\n* Practiced data structures/algorithms for a few months only to completely blank on final round phone interviews\n  * Though I agree that the technical interview process is broken, I think there are still some lessons that can be learned. I suck at thinking under pressure so I'm going to learn to improve this by trying to keep my practice environment as similar to the real thing as possible. In this case, doing mock interviews with friends rather than just blindly grinding away at LeetCode.\n\n* Got a 52% on an honours math midterm\n  * It was an extremely difficult course but it really changed how I think about math and problem solving overall. I doubt I would've been able to learn those lessons in a regular math course. Even if the actual marks I got in the course were subpar at best, I think the lessons I learned were worth more than the GPA dent.\n\n* Rejected by Hack the North (despite being on their website ???)\n  * Sometimes even when all the cards seem to be in your favour, things just don't work out. There's a factor of luck in everything \u0026mdash; dont take things for granted!\n\n* Got charged an excess of $350CAD in cloud computing costs because of bad architectural decisions\n  * Ouch, this one really hurt the wallet. Learn to estimate costs in advance, and don't overengineer if you don't need to! Keep it to the simplest and most minimal viable product possible until you're ready to scale it. If it doesn't need huge infrastructure, don't design it that way!\n\n## 2018\n\n* Rejected by 16 of the 17 universities I applied to\n  * This was a good reality check \u0026mdash; the real world is difficult. Sometimes, what you offer may not be what the universities are looking for and thats ok! I think what matters more is what you do, not where you do it.\n\n* Rejected from a bunch of scholarships\n\n* Applied to speak at TEDxRedmond but got rejected at the last round\n  * I ended up learning a lot about my topic (ethics in AI and machine learning) through preparing for my speech. Even if I never got the chance to actually go up on stage and see it, the subject still ocassionally comes up in conversation and makes a great talking point! I think its super important to be educated on this, especially as our world becomes increasingly dominated by AI and machine learning.\n\n* Gave up on my DroneNet project after running out of money to work on it and little to no progress for multiple months\n  * This was my first **real** long term project and probably the project that got me really invested in the field of CS. I learned a lot about how to scope out and plan larger scale projects and how to stay motivated for long stretches of time.\n\n[^1]: [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/smarter-living/failure-resume.html)\n[^2]: [Kat Huang's](https://www.katmh.com/fail/)\n[^3]: [Joice Tang's](https://www.notion.so/failure-resume-5e67efb72dfe4f4896bc812ed94dc098)",

    "title": "Machines and Intelligence",
    "content": "\nThis blog post is adapted from a term paper I wrote for PHIL250: Minds and Machines at UBC. I hope you enjoy the post and learn as much as I did in writing it!\n\n---\n\n## Introduction\nHistorically, development of AI has taken a very specific approach \u0026mdash; systems that represent the world through symbols and manipulate those tokens in a systematic way to arrive at a result. This type of AI was coined Good Old-Fashioned AI (GOFAI) by John Haugeland[^1]. \n\nThis worked well up until around 1984 when the field entered an 'AI Winter', a long plateau in progress that was most likely due cynicism in the AI research community that trickled to media and [funding](thoughts/funding.md) bodies, halting research and development[^2].\n\nHowever, with the rise of Moore's Law and the insane amount of compute and data available, a new approach to the development of AI arose \u0026mdash; one that focused on statistical methods and connectionist networks like artificial neural networks[^2]. Haugeland[^1] dubbed this approach to AI design New Fangled AI (NFAI).\n\nThis paper will examine factors that differentiate GOFAI and NFAI systems, such as their ability to adapt to changes in input, and the explainability of their outputs and internal representations. It will also examine current work in integrating the two approaches to Artificial Intelligence to create an artificial general intelligence.\n\n### GOFAI Systems\nSince the inception of the term GOFAI, the basic idea has remained unchanged: thinking as internal symbol manipulation. Within these GOFAI systems, symbols are representative of aspects of our world. These symbols are manipulated in a systematic and logical matter, performing a series of deterministic steps that results in another sequence of symbols[^1].\n\nA very common example of GOFAI systems are expert systems, which are computer systems that emulate the decision making ability of a human expert[^3]. They solve problems via decision-tree reasoning, figuring out whether to perform certain actions based off of if-then rules.\n\nHowever, just being able to solve a problem shouldn't be sufficient for intelligence. So what qualifies it? At its core, GOFAI can be considered 'artificially intelligent' because of semantic interpretation. If the symbols represent aspects of our world, the result, which is also a symbol sequence, can be *translated* back into aspects of our world. This is called semantic interpretation, which \"seeks to construe a body of symbols so that what they mean ('say') turns out to be consistently reasonable and sensible, given the situation\"[^1]. \n\n### NFAI Systems\nNFAI, on the other hand, is a diverse and still rapidly evolving set of systems and algorithms. It is more of a grab-bag term, roughly meaning any sort of scientific mind design that is not GOFAI[^1]. Under this umbrella are connectionist networks, which are networks composed of lots of simple units that are interconnected with various strengths. This paper will mostly focus on connectionism as a synecdoche for the greater umbrella of NFAI.\n\nSome classic examples of connectionist networks include convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are a form of image classifiers[^4]. These networks operate by applying filters or kernels to an input between layers of the network. Each of those filters have their own set of strengths that will learn and evolve over time to identify certain 'features' from the input. Similar to cell assemblies in animal perceptual systems, these filters assemble more complex patterns using smaller and simpler patterns[^5].\n\nThese connectionist networks are very inspired by the structure of the brain, with its hierarchical patterns and compositional nature[^6], rather than the rational manipulation of symbols that is observed in GOFAI.\n\n## The Potemkin Village Analogy\nWhile it is obvious that GOFAI and NFAI are very different approaches to constructing AI systems, how do they differ in their resilience to failure? An analogy that may be useful in visualizing this is a [potemkin village](thoughts/potemkin%20village.md) \u0026mdash; a fake village that is built to resemble and deceive others into thinking it is real. AI systems attempt to build a sort of 'potemkin village' that \"works well on naturally occurring data, but is exposed as fake when one visits points in space that do not have high probability\"[^7].\n\nGOFAI systems are excellent at \"processing syntactical patterns like those characteristic of logical formulae, ordinary sentences, and many inferences\"[^1], but are also very narrow-minded and vulnerable when it comes to unexpected variations or oddities in the input given. The potemkin village that a GOFAI system may construct will hold up if only seen from the intended angles, but any slight deviation from an intended or expected input would shatter the illusion immediately.\n\nNFAI systems, on the other hand, are \"adept at finding various sort of similarities among patterns, at recognizing repeated (or almost repeated) patterns and filling in missing parts of incomplete patterns\"[^1]. These also happen to be the exact things that GOFAI systems struggle with. The potemkin village that a NFAI system may construct will hold up much more robustly to unexpected patterns or noisy input, but will, at heart, still be a fake village.\n\n## Rationality and explainability\nIn GOFAI systems, [intentionality](thoughts/intentionality.md) \u0026mdash; the meaning and semantics behind the tokens \u0026mdash; is injected through explicit programming by those who create it. These GOFAI systems are able to process these tokens and make conclusions based off of logic and reason rather than just trial-and-error. Case in point, expert systems. These if-then statements can easily explain decisions by showing which parts evaluated as true or false in its decision making process[^3]. \n\n[Connectionist networks](thoughts/connectionist%20networks.md), for the most part, are very hard to explain and are often dubbed black-box models due to the hidden nature of its internal workings. Unlike GOFAI systems, its internal representation model is defined by the state of the entire network rather than that of any single unit \u0026mdash; this is commonly referred to as a distributed model of connectionist representation[^8] and is often claimed to be one of the distinctive features of connectionism.\n\n## Models of [representation](thoughts/representation.md)\nTo put it in sound terminology, note while in the GOFAI system, the *tokens* are the objects of formal processing, so the system which manipulates the tokens is the actual vehicle of computation. The tokens themselves are also *representations* of aspects of the world, so they are also vehicles of mental content. In GOFAI systems, tokens are both the vehicle of computation and the vehicle of mental content.\n\nThis is in contrast with connectionist systems, where computation is performed at the level of simple units (unit activations, backpropagation), meaning the units are the vehicles of computation. However, as these systems use a distributed model of representation, it is not a single unit that represents something, but rather the \"network state as a whole thats interpreted as representing\"[^8]. Thus, in connectionist systems, the vehicles of computation (units) need to be the vehicles of representation (network state).\n\n## Integrating GOFAI and NFAI\nGiven that GOFAI and NFAI systems seem so vastly different in their approaches to AI, how might one go about reconciling them?\n\nOne approach is to combine both into one system. This is used when there’s a rational, known, and algorithmic way to process a subproblem. Systems like AlphaZero, a connectionist based Go playing system, use mixed systems to achieve the level of performance they report. Although at heart, AlphaZero uses a deep neural network to assess new positions, it also uses a Monte Carlo Tree Search (a GOFAI algorithm) to determine its next move based of the assessment of the neural net[^9].\n\nAnother, less researched method, are interpretable connectionist systems. As traditional connectionist networks rely on the network state being the vehicle of representation, the complexity, depth, and scale of modern connectionist models means that it is becoming increasingly difficult for humans to interpret the output. The field of [explainable](thoughts/explainability.md) AI (XAI) focuses on incentivizing connectionist networks to develop localist representations (i.e. moving away from having the vehicle of representation be at the network level, but at the unit level). Zhang, Wu, and Zhu of UCLA recently showed that it is possible to train a CNN to use 'interpretable filters', which encourage networks to group feature detectors into single filters, showing the possibility of moving from distributed representations to more local representations[^5].\n\n### What is AGI?\nWhile intelligence can be understood in many ways, this paper will focus on examining the prospects of emulating or achieving the capacity to understand or learn anything a human can \u0026mdash; the hallmark of an artificial general intelligence (AGI).\n\nMost commentators would agree that current AI systems fall short of implementing general intelligence[^4]. These are narrow AI systems, which are used to accomplish or solve specific tasks like the game of Go or language translation, rather than to attempt to create a system capable of AGI. So, what's stopping us from making the transition from domain-specific algorithms to domain-general algorithms?\n\nOne problem that stumped earlier attempts at AGI was the *common-sense problem*: how do we represent common-sense information that is obvious to most humans in a way that is accessible to AI systems that use natural language? Unsurprisingly, the problem of storing all of this information was solved by the massive explosion in compute and data in the past few decades[^2]. However, the difficult part of this problem, choosing what subset of that huge information bank is relevant in any situation, remains a huge unsolved problem. How do we update our database of knowledge when relationships between symbols change? This is referred to as the [frame problem](thoughts/frame%20problem.md).\n\n### Dissolving the frame problem\nDreyfus[^10] posits that any AI systems which attempt to tackle the frame problem through storing relevant frames are bound to failure. He argues that, \"human beings do not simply store common-sense information,\" rather they \"directly perceive and act upon significance in their environment\". In his view, a more Heideggerian approach to AI will dissolve this problem.\n\nHeideggerian AI, in its most basic sense, is concerned with \nthe Heideggerian concept of Dasein, which literally means 'Being-there'[^11]. Through the use of this expression, Heidegger calls to attention the fact that a human cannot exist or be taken into account without existing in [context](thoughts/context.md) of a world with other things \u0026mdash; \"to be human is to be fixed, embedded, and immersed in the physical, literal, tangible day to day world\"[^12].\n\nDreyfus believed that, for any AI system to achieve any sort of general intelligence, it must also exhibit Dasein. Thus, \"a successful Heideggerian AI would need a perfect model of the human body – and by implication, that Dasein must be expressed as a human being, organically as well as existentially\"[^10].\n\n### A non-humanistic approach\nHowever, Steed refutes Dreyfus' overly humanistic interpretation of Heideggerian AI, believing that a AI model only needs to be \"embedded and embodied such that what AI experiences is significant for AI in the particular way that AI is,\" and thus intelligence would be possible by Heideggerian standards[^13].\n\nThe refutation against a purely anthropocentric view of AI brings to light an important concept: the [multiple realization](thoughts/multiple%20realization.md) argument. Emulating or copying human intelligence isn't the only way to achieve intelligence that rivals that of humans.\n\nContemporary AI systems are almost always used as a problem solving tool, a means to tackle uniquely human problems and to convey results that are semantically useful to us. As a result, these approaches are doomed to be constrained by human problems. This is the essense of the [bitter lesson of AI](thoughts/multiple%20realization.md). However, if we look outside the anthropocentric view of intelligence, AI systems may not share these human problems with us and \"perhaps an authentic, free AI system does not converge to a solution that is interpretable from a human standpoint at all\"[^13]. \n\nAI is already capable of learning, adaptation, and basic Being-in-the-world. Thus, to achieve general intelligence, we should allow AI to contemplate its own problems and existence.\n\n[^1]: Huageland, John.

    "title": "On AI's 'Bias Bug'",
    "content": "\nThis blog post was originally intended to be a TED Talk given at TEDxRedmond but I unfortunately was never accepted. However, I did learn a lot in the process of writing it, and I hope you get some value out of it even its presented through just text.\n\n---\n\n## Hey Google\nTake a picture in 5 seconds. Say cheese!\n\nSee that? This is just one of many examples of where AI is becoming a larger part of what we accept as normal. What seemed far-fetched and straight out of science fiction a few years ago is now becoming a reality. \n\nToday, tech giants deploy AI to dictate what we see, hear, buy – even feel and think. They control what kind of news we see every morning, suggest places to go, and even drive our cars. In order for us to have a healthy relationship with this technology, we have to adapt as quickly as it is advancing. In doing so, we need to ask ourselves: what kind of decisions AI should be allowed to make?\n\n### What kind of decisions AI should be allowed to make?\n\nSure, most of you in the audience may be comfortable letting an AI decide what kind of music to add to your Spotify playlist, but when an AI needs to decide what kind of jail time a criminal should face we all get a little squeamish.\n\nIn fact, let me give you a few examples of decisions that AI make every single day and see whether you would be comfortable with an AI making that same decision.\n\n![An AI-based breast cancer detector in action](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BCz28oA5THs/W7_1x671dkI/AAAAAAAADXg/h6OcOZnRZl0vN8mw02gNVcwglJTqE87bwCLcBGAs/s1600/image1.png)*Google AI Blog, 2018*\nWould you be comfortable with an AI helping doctors to identify cancerous tumours?\n\n![A game of Survival of the Best Fit](/posts/images/bias-bug/hiring.png)*survivalofthebestfit.com*\nHow about an AI helping companies decide who to hire based on only your name, age, gender, and resume?\n\n![Chihuahua or muffin?](https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2016_10/1008761/chihuahua-muffin-today-160311-tease-02_15277fe1b7a8c911f94700f866189fc2.social_share_1024x512_center.jpg)*@teenybiscuit*\nThe classic image detection example: are these chihuahuas or muffins?\n\n![A modified version of the trolley problem](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*dCk2Jns5Deg4Y2O6KBcuzA.jpeg)*Illustration: Simon Landrein*\nHow about the trolley problem? Should a self-driving car \u0026mdash; given no other option \u0026mdash; kill A) the child or B) the elderly person?\n\nAs you can see, there is a really obvious difference each of those decisions that were proposed. In the tumour example and chihuahua example, you likely weren't super bothered if an AI were to make that decision. Yet for the hiring example and the self-driving car example, you likely were more uncertain.\n\n### Why the uncertainty?\n\nWhat we can see from this is that there is a difference between objective and subjective problems. In the tumour and chihuahua examples, we were mostly comfortable with that decision being made because there is a clear ‘right’ or ‘wrong.’ However, in the case of the hiring example and self-driving car example, the subjectivity makes it difficult. A lot of it has to do with what kind of environment we were raised in and how each of us sees the world. Everyone is born with some kind of bias, favouring certain ways of viewing the world.\n\nAI can do a lot of really great things such as helping doctors identify tumours or interpret the world for the deaf. But when used improperly, that subjectivity can propel some of the worst biases we have as humans.\n\n## Garbage in, garbage out\n\nThere’s a timeless saying “garbage in, garbage out” in the field of Computer Science which essentially states that bad data or bad input will produce an output that’s of equal quality. This holds true for almost all the tech we use today, from trading algorithms to search results. If what we put into the system is inherently unclear or flawed, then the output will also give back something that’s ‘wrong’ or doesn’t align with our objectives.\n\nHowever, this saying “garbage in, garbage out” is most prevalent in the AI which sits at the forefront of this tech revolution. AI, in one form or another, is still created by humans, who are imperfect, make mistakes, and are inherently biased.\n\nInterestingly, there are two distinct ways that this bias can shine through.\n\n### 1. Problem definition\n   \nThe first is in the problem definition. When creating an AI, we need to define an objective for it. That means putting something vague like “create a realistic human-sounding voice” or “help me translate this speech to French” into definitive, and certain terms and mathematical concepts. How do we do that? Because we don’t have algorithms that do this step for us, this is usually done by a team of machine learning engineers. They are responsible for deciding how to represent our ‘objective’ in terms of penalties and rewards. This also means that how the team of engineers decide to represent the problem is a product of their biases. \n\nTake Amazon for example. In 2014, Amazon decided to create a recruitment engine that was able to look at a job applicant and rate them from a one-star rating to a five-star rating. However, by 2015, Amazon realized that their software was not evaluating candidates for positions related to tech in a gender-neutral way[^4]. Although unintentionally, Amazon’s engineers included a gender field. The algorithm, after sifting through 10 years worth of resumes, began to favour men and penalize women. After deeper inspection, this was most likely an unfortunate reflection of the male-dominated tech industry. The lesson is clear. The algorithm served to reflect this bias that was observed in the past.\n\n### 2. Lack of Data Diversity \nThe second, less obvious way bias can poison AI is with [data diversity](thoughts/data%20distributions.md) \u0026mdash; or rather the lack of it. I think the best way to explain this is through a metaphor. Imagine the AI as a small child. It likes to learn from its environment. If this child were to be raised in a racist family, it will almost undoubtedly hold similar views in the future. This is a very similar case for AI. It learns from the environment and data it's given.\n\nOne case of this is the very first iteration of Google Photo’s image classification feature back in 2015. This feature claimed to be able to identify people, places, and things with high accuracy. Twitter user [@jackyalcine](https://twitter.com/jackyalcine/) found that the algorithm identified people with darker skin as gorillas[^3]. Google quickly was able to work and manually ‘patch’ the issue, but the actual issue was much deeper – and it had to do with the data used. In this case, the dataset that Google used to train their algorithm had an over proportional amount of middle-aged Caucasian people under the category of ‘people.’ This meant that while the recognition accuracy was really high for that select group of people, the accuracy for people of colour was significantly worse. \n\nFrom both cases, we can see that an over-focus on results and accuracy can cause these companies to ignore these [biases](thoughts/bias.md). When the deadline is too tight or the manager sets an expectation for a “10% increase in accuracy,” there is a very strong incentive to ignore the ‘edge cases’ or things that happen very rarely.\n\nToo often our society is focused on the raw accuracy that we forget that the same accuracy metric is something that we set for ourselves – created arbitrarily by humans which have bias. Unfortunately, this results in things like the Google Photos and Amazon Hiring cases.\n\n## Fairness in AI\nTruth is, data lacks [context](thoughts/context.md). While the trends in the data may show that in the past there have been more men in the women in the workforce, the majority of the population can agree that we are moving away from that more traditional view into more of an equal playing ground. Unfortunately, these models that we create don’t have a deeper understanding of these changes and as a result, produces naïve predictions that we believe are wrong or ‘garbage.’ But is it really? Is it really only a ‘bad’ result because of what we define as fair or right?\n\n![COMPAS exhibiting bias against those of African descent](https://static.propublica.org/projects/algorithmic-bias/assets/img/generated/methodology-risk-of-recidivism-scores-by-race-900*363-482d1c.png)*ProPublica, 2016*\n\nWe can take a look at the COMPAS system which is a piece of software used by U.S. courts to assess the likelihood of a criminal to reoffend. ProPublica, a non-profit newsroom, did an investigation back in 2016[^1] and claimed that COMPAS was biased against those of African descent \u0026mdash; citing that it overestimated the false positive rate of reoffending for those of African descent by almost twice as high as those for Caucasians. ProPublica reasoned that a fair algorithm would not have such a big difference.\n\n### So, is COMPAS fair?\nWell, there’s no concrete answer.  The algorithm never had any access to any contextual information about the neighbourhoods or the actual situation for each of the offenses. Was the area more heavily policed because it was a predominantly black neighbourhood? Were the officers themselves biased in making arrests?\n\nEven more interestingly, a study done at Dartmouth[^2] showed that random volunteers, when given the same information as the COMPAS algorithm, achieved a nearly identical accuracy of identifying the rate of recidivism.\n\nThis is interesting. This means that either COMPAS is accurate or holds the exact same biases as we do as a society. Unfortunately, this is a problem that I don’t think we can solve, so we don’t have a solid definition as to what makes an algorithm fair. But what is clear, is that there is bias in play here, whether that be through the police, the companies, the actual algorithm, or society itself. This bias is what causes that “subjectivity” and “garbage in.” This is what is preventing us from making ‘fairer’ AI and applying AI to more tasks.\n\n### The inevitability of bias\nThe point is, unless we work to prevent, catch, and deter bias, it will inevitably occur. One of the biggest problems in the field of AI is that so many of the models exist in a black box, meaning that its inner workings are only known by a select few. This makes it near impossible to identify and train out bias. Machine intelligence will become almost integral to our lives, becoming less visible in the process, and AI’s bias bug will get harder to beat. Our time to act is now.\n\n## What we can do\n\u003e So? What can we, as the next generation, do to help?\n\nFirst, we need to build a [better understanding](thoughts/explainability.md) of how the AI systems we are building work. Through this understanding, we can better [trust](thoughts/trust.md) and, as a result, effectively manage the emerging generation of AI. So, don’t be afraid to learn that programming language you heard about. Read up on how that cool translation algorithm works. \n\nSecondly, we need to diversify. Diversify not only in the sense of having better representation in datasets, but in tech. Next time you pitch a new product, or create a new project, ask yourself this:\n\n\u003e “How many people have you considered before you make that decision?”\n\nLet's [design for everyone](thoughts/Design%20Justice.md). Consider people of different ethnic groups, sexualities, income, just to name a few. By having more representation in these teams, AI can cater to more than just that select group of people who are western, educated, and rich. Instead, by bringing in a fresh perspective on the problems that these teams are trying to tackle, they can create innovation that benefits a whole range of communities. \n\nWith increased diversity and representation, the Google Photo misidentification problem never would have happened. Together, we can help to build a future where diversity is no longer an issue in both machine learning models and tech, but society too. Where we don’t just use AI mindlessly but understand it and use it in such a way that it helps to empower humanity. Where we can work towards a future where we can begin to trust the more subjective decisions that an AI can make.\n\nTogether, we can make that future a reality tomorrow.

    "title": "Collaborative Thinking",
    "content": "\nRecently, I've been reading **21 Lessons for the 21st Century** written by none other than Yuval Noah Harari, and have been enjoying the book. Its approach to weaving together insights from a vast number of disciplines to create something novel is extremely refreshing. I just read a section on learning, the knowledge illusion, and collaborative thinking and wanted to share some of my thoughts that have been bouncing around and marinating for a few days as well as some learnings that I've applied to my own life.\n\n## Collaborative Thinking\n\u003e Humans rarely think for themselves. Rather, we think in groups. Just as it takes a tribe to raise a child, it also takes a tribe to invent a tool, solve a conflict, or cure a disease. No individual knows everything it takes to build a cathedral, an atom bomb, or an aircraft. \n\nIt is no secret that the key to the rise of *Homo Sapiens* and the anthropocene wasn't due to the rationality of any individual human, but rather our collective unparalleled ability to think and share knowledge in large groups. This concept has arisen in the form of *specialization of labour*.\n\nAs a society, we consistently rely on the knowledge of others to live our own comfortable lives. I may not know how to grow my very own russet potatoes, but a farmer in Alberta might. Similarly, a plumber in Massachusetts may not know how to build their own website, but I might. Through being able to supplement each other's knowledge of the world, our *collective* knowledge is much greater.\n\n![Left: Collective knowledge of the group. Right: My subset of knowledge](/posts/images/collaborative-thinking/knowledge.png)*Left: Collective knowledge of the group. Right: My subset of knowledge*\n\nI like to think about collective knowledge as a big blob. Each individual contributes a unique *subset* of knowledge. We get the entirety of human knowledge by taking the *union of the knowledge* of all the individuals in the group. Of course, as these groups of individuals grow ever larger due to globalization, each individual may choose to specialize in a narrower subset of knowledge as generations go on to reduce redundancy. Why know how to build your own car when you can buy it yourself? The adoption of globally accepted currencies has made this easier than ever.\n\n## Knowledge illusion\nHumans also have this 'knowledge illusion' where we think we know a lot, even though individually we know very little. We treat the knowledge of the human collective as if it were our own, even subconsciously.\n\n![A crude illustration of a jacket zipper](/posts/images/collaborative-thinking/zipper.png)*A crude illustration of a jacket zipper*\n\nAn example Harari used was the sweater zipper. If I were to ask you if you knew how a zipper works, the vast majority of you would exclaim \"yes, of course!\" Yet, if asked to describe in *detail* every single step, most would fail to do so. Even with something that seems so basic and intuitive seems to elude an explicit explanation. We have begun to stand on the shoulders of giants yet refuse to acknowledge their presence.\n\nAlthough we may have increased the overall area of our collective knowledge, the surface area of each individual has also shrunken, turning from balanced and broad to narrow and unwieldy.\n\n## Rebalancing our blob of knowledge\nAnother interesting property about the knowledge blobs of individuals is that they are *magnetic*. I mean this in the sense that individuals that have one blob of knowledge tend to attract and be attracted to individuals with similar orientations and shapes in their blobs of knowledge, much like how magnetic dipoles align in a magnet. As humans, we tend to want to minimize our cognitive dissonance and surrounding ourselves with like-minded individuals is the easiest way to do that.\n\nIndividuals in these clusters experience a sort of echo chamber effect whereby the *magnitude* of their knowledge is amplified through the mutual alignment of their knowledge. However, this also poses a unique challenge where movement only happens in one direction and there is little to no room to deviate from that direction and try something new; something incredibly dangerous for innovation. This, in a sense, is turning collaborative thinking into groupthink.\n\n\u003e People afraid of losing their truth tend to be more violent than people who are used to looking at the world from several different viewpoints.\n\n![Broadening our base fundamental knowledge. Blue: Previous 'specialized' knowledge. Purple: broad foundational knowledge](/posts/images/collaborative-thinking/spikes.png)*Blue: Previous 'specialized' knowledge. Purple: broad foundational knowledge*\n\nWhat we can do to counteract this extreme alignment is to build a broader foundation of knowledge. When you come across an individual with differing views, hopefully you will at least have the base fundamental knowledge to understand their perspective.\n\n## Learning communities\nThis, at least in part, is why I've recently become more certain of wanting to go to [academia](/thoughts/academia) in the future. I used to have tunnel-vision in thinking that all I wanted to do in the future was to just work in industry CS. Recently, I've started to realize that CS not a single discipline, but rather it's a tool that can help solve uniquely human problems, and these human problems are inherently multidisciplinary.\n\nI've started to read and learn more about the world around me outside of my little bubble of CS-related topics and it's been eye-opening to see issues I read about in my philosophy class come up in a linguistics lecture which in turn comes up in a book I'm reading. I've found that the best way for me to cement my learning and understanding is through discussion with people, rather than just sitting and ruminating on my own -- a very different pace than the typical *code-Stackoverflow-copy-repeat* self-learning cycle that most programmers (including myself) are familiar with.\n\nThe important part of learning communities like colleges is not necessarily the alignment in what you're studying, but rather in the shared mindset of discussion, learning, and understanding. To broaden my foundation of knowledge is to read more about the opinions and findings of others and to critically discuss these among peers who may have different views. If we want our specialized knowledge to be applicable in a wide range of situations, we need a broad foundational base that can support that.\n\n## Wiggle room\n\u003e If you want to go deeply into any subject, you need a lot of time, and in particular, you need the privilege of wasting time. You need to experiment with unproductive paths, explore dead ends, make space for doubts and boredom, and allow little seeds of insight to slowly grow and blossom\n\nFor me, learning is very close to a [zero sum](thoughts/zero%20sum.md) game. I can only expand the area of my knowledge blob so fast. If I want to broaden my foundational knowledge base, I need to reign in the amount of time spent growing purely technical strengths and to stop saying 'yes' to any and every opportunity that comes up.\n\nSlowly but surely, I'm learning to value my own time and to set it aside to just absorb more about the world and to extend the reaches of my knowledge just a little bit further. To dilly-dally among the Wikipedia rabbit holes, cultivate [my digital garden](/posts/digital-gardening), and faff among the ridiculously long list of side projects I planned to start. I'm experimenting with what I previously thought were deadends and little seeds of insight are starting to grow. Maybe I'll find something interesting to share among the construction of this broader foundation.\n\n**Acknowledgements**\n\nA big thank yu to [Anson](https://twitter.com/ansonyuu) for always being a sounding board for fresh dough (half-baked ideas would be too generous of a description for these).

    "title": "Framing and Context Collapse",
    "content": "\n![Abstract illustration of a blob framed by two picture frames](/posts/images/framing/title.png)\n\nThe content I throw on Twitter is not something I would readily post on LinkedIn. I also wouldn't post LinkedIn-style business content to my Facebook timeline. To an extent, my social presence across these platforms is *incongruent*. The core tenet is that different apps curate different types of communities and thus social contexts. As a result, we try to separate these contexts in the best way we know how to: by acting differently, **and that's ok.** \n\nIt is not 'inconsistent' for us to want to frame ourselves differently on Twitter than on Facebook, and in fact, a lot of key aspects of human behaviour point to why we default to doing so.\n\nThe problem comes when these spaces start bleeding into each other, and the boundaries between the different audiences on each of them start amalgamating. The *overlap* in target audience between these spaces then becomes very large and all of these different social contexts ['collapse'](https://www.rewire.org/context-collapse-online/) and it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain these separate personalities.\n\n## What's (not) in the frame\nIn this [vlogbrothers video from March](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRZuEGuU_es), John Green talks about the metaphorical frame in which people present themselves. We tailor and adjust our behaviour depending on the environment we're in, or the audience we find ourselves in front of. However, in doing so, we inadvertently portray an incomplete picture – we frame only the parts we want them to see.\n\n\u003e \"I mean of course the central trick of the social internet, is that whenever you make something, you choose what's inside the frame, but as viewers the rest of us can't help but believe what's inside the frame, because it's literally all we can see\"\n\nAn unfortunate side effect of this is that it starts setting expectations for the audience as to how we 'normally' behave. This 'audience' of people can be friends, followers, or strangers. They are a group of people that pay attention to what *you* have to say because of your thoughts, opinions, and general persona. So what happens when we change?\n\nIf we're expected to keep growing as people, these thoughts and opinions will obviously change over time. So why does it feel so *weird*, for both the audience and ourselves, to deviate from these set identities that we've become used to portraying in certain scenarios?\n\n## Context separation\n![Abstract illustration of a blob framed by two picture frames](/posts/images/framing/context-separation.png)\n\nIn order to answer that question, let us make a brief foray into the realm of psychology. Why do humans tend to act differently in different environments? I think three key aspects of behaviour play a role here:\n\n### People are unique\nNo one individual has the exact same interests, goals, values, and identity as you. We have different friends and environments, so we create different contexts in which we can exercise different aspects of ourselves. People find spaces where they can authentically express all the dimensions of themselves. If a situation only exercises one axis of our self-identity, we will actively seek out places to exercise other axes.\n\n### Behaviour is sticky\nIt is easier to travel along a path well-travelled than one covered in weeds and bush -- if you do something once, it becomes easier to do it again. Similarly, doing something with a certain context once means it becomes easier to repeat that same behaviour in that context again. If I use Twitter as my social media of choice to post memes, I'm likely to continue using it like so.\n\nIn some ways, this is Newton's First Law but applied to behaviour: if you do something one way, you are likely to keep doing things in that way unless encouraged to do otherwise.\n\n### Individuals tend to conform to [group norms](thoughts/social%20contracts.md)\nIn 1951, Solomon Asch conducted [an experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments) to investigate the extent of which social pressures can affect a person's behaviour. In this experiment, he asked, \"Which line is the longest out of the three given?\". In an individual setting, 99% of people answered correctly. However, when put in a room of actors instructed to answer incorrectly, nearly 75% of all participants gave at least one incorrect answer throughout 12 trials.\n\nPeople conform for two main reasons:\n1. They want to fit in with the [group](/thoughts/communities) **(normative influence)**\n2. They believe the group is better informed than they are **(informational influence)**\n\nHistorically, having different behaviours in different contexts may have been evolutionarily beneficial, helping us to better collaborate and form connections with each other without causing undue conflict.\n\nEven as children, when we get hurt, we look to authority figures around us to see how to react. If our mother comes to us expressing worry and concern, we cry. If everyone around us continues to play as if everything is normal, we will brush aside the injury and continue to play with the group.\n\nOur ability to 'frame' ourselves different depending on the social situation likely stemmed from this behaviour too.\n\n\n## Why context collapse is bad\n![Abstract illustration of a blob framed by two picture frames](/posts/images/framing/context-collapse.png)\n\nWhen experiencing context collapse, talking to your audience beyond a surface level becomes very difficult. Smaller groups, by nature, have more commonalities to relate to, whether that be interests, music taste, place of study, or lived experiences. These groups provide the chance for individuals to have intimate conversations and exercise different facets of themselves that they otherwise wouldn't get the chance to. A queer person may be out to a close group of friends but not to their family; a budding writer can have a safe place to explore potential ideas without alienating the rest of their friend group.\n\nWhen we experience context collapse, these social groups and audiences become massive, and the amount of overlap in interests or values of the collective group is miniscule. How are you supposed to have any sort of meaningful connection when the only thing you share in common on the platform is that you ‘know’ each other?\n\n## Centrifuging contexts\nI’ve noticed three main strategies individuals, companies, and platforms have adopted in trying to tackle context collapse.\n\n1. **Lowest Common Denominator** ([Vanilla Ice Cream effect](thoughts/Vanilla%20Ice%20Cream%20effect.md)). Only making posts that anybody will be able to understand and relate to, staying away from controversial or overly personal topics. This approach places an emphasis on quantity of impressions over quality of impressions.\n\n2. **Realtime**. Platforms and individuals are leaning more towards [ephemereal content](thoughts/ephemereal%20content.md), like stories or streaming. The 'live' aspect of it means that the audience is encouraged to interact immediately, creating a tighter feedback loop with the audience.\n\n3. **Fragmentation**. Purposefully having conversations in places where your audience is smaller, like group chats, direct messages, or small closed communities. In these cases, the specific context and audience is well-defined. More users are also turning to 'finstas' which are accounts focused for a closed group of friends and family rather than the entire public [internet](thoughts/Internet.md)r.\n\nI don’t think there is a single 'right' approach, and in part that's why so many types of social networks exist today: they each have their own merits that incentive different approaches to communication. But one part I do want to emphasize is the tradeoff of depth and breadth in these approaches.\n\n## Social bandwidth\nI think in part, this is why nobody has been successful in creating a single social network to replace all of the existing apps. As humans, we want the ability to closely connect with people, and context collapses makes that exceedingly difficult. We have limited social [bandwidth](thoughts/bandwidth.md) -- there's only so much attention we can give to everyone. By increasing the breadth of our audience, we reduce the depth at which we can communicate with each individual. As app developers rush to combine all of these platforms into one, maybe we should step back and think whether this is really necessary.\n\nOn these larger social media apps where I'm 'connected' to hundreds of people, I don't feel like I can have very insightful conversations or thoughts. Those conversations almost exclusively happen in communities like [nwPlus](http://nwplus.io/) and [Reboot](https://twitter.com/reboot_hq/) where there is enough alignment of values and interests that we can scrape past the surface level chit chat and get to really exploring ideas and knowing people.\n\nBecause we're so actively a part of all of these different contexts, we are forced to be excessively general on these platforms to try to cater to everyone. We should have platforms where it's ok to engage with different elements of who you are. We have different groups of friends to cater to different aspects of who we are, so why should social media platforms be any different?\n\nDifferent social contexts call for different social behaviours, and that's ok.\n\n*Special thanks to Anson, Ivan, Rishi, Joss, Jasmine, Kat, and Anh for helping read over and edit this piece!

    "title": "Rewriting ctrl-v using Next.js",
    "content": "\n![Rewriting ctrl-v using Next.js](/posts/images/ctrlv-next/title.png)\n\nEver since I released [ctrl-v](https://github.com/jackyzha0/ctrl-v/), friends from HackClub have kept bugging me about switching my current React code over to use Next.js. I wanted to see what all the fuss was about, so I finally set aside some time this weekend to rewrite the frontend using Next.js and deployed it on Vercel instead of Firebase Hosting. I thought it would take the whole weekend, but I managed to go from zero knowledge about Next.js to a fully finished refactor in just under 6 hours!\n\nThis will be more of a technical blog post walking through my process in converting ctrl-v from using React Router and Firebase Hosting to Next.js and Firebase.\n\nSource code: https://github.com/jackyzha0/ctrl-v\n\n## Learning Next.js\nI'm a very hands-on learner. I learn the fastest stumbling my way through a project with a framework I barely know my way around than watching multiple video examples or reading blog posts. Having a tangible project to work with and break as I learned things really helped speed up the learning process for me. That being said, here are a few other resources I found really helpful in my journey!  \n\n* [Next.js in 100 seconds + good beginner tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sklc_fQBmcs)\n* [Twiddling around with `create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app)\n* [Next.js official documentation for migrating from React Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/migrating/from-react-router)\n\n## Why Next.js\nThe main reason I wanted to switch to Next.js is because it makes it dead easy to implement both Static Site Generation (SSG) and Server Side Rendering (SSR) for your React app. For those uninitiated, SSR and SSG are different approaches to rendering content.\n\nIn **Client Side Rendering (CSR)**, the client is responsible for rendering the content on the page. All they receive is an empty HTML document, and a bunch of JavaScript bundles through which the browser populates the page. The downside of this approach is that no content exists on the page when it is first loaded. As a result, web crawlers won't be able to find your content (not great for SEO), and you won't get link previews to your content as the page metadata won't have loaded. This is the behaviour you get when you use plain old React.\n\nIn **Server Side Rendering (SSR)**, the server is responsible for rendering the content of the page and sending the fully rendered the content to the user to display. In this approach, all the content is already loaded when the user is receives it, we only need JavaScript to make it interactable (i.e. hydrate it). As a result, this approach is a lot more SEO friendly.\n\nOn the very other end of the spectrum, **Static Site Generation (SSG)**, means that the server does all of the page rendering at *build time* rather than on each request. This has all the same benefits as SSR but doesn't really make a lot of sense for this project as I don't have a full list of pages I need to render handy.\n\n**A hybrid approach**\n\nHowever, Next.js doesn't force you to choose between the two. It actually prides itself in just how easy they make it to switch between them. Here's the approach I decided to take for ctrl-v. \n\nIn the old frontend, everything was completely client-side rendered. My 'productionized' application was quite literally an `index.html` with a bunch of JS bundles. It sucked as whenever I sent a ctrl-v link to a friend, there wouldn't be a preview about what the content was and most people were scared to just open a random link like that (rightfully so). There was also a not-very-pleasant 'loading paste...' period before any content actually appeared on the screen.\n\n![Old vs new approaches to rendering content](/posts/images/ctrlv-next/rendering.png)\n\nI realized that there were only really two main types of pages\n1. View Paste (`/:paste`)\n2. Create Paste (`/`)\n\nNothing on the create paste page actually required hitting the backend, it was effectively completely static. I could safely just replace that entire page and have it be statically generated at build time. The view paste page required me to make a call to ctrl-v's backend API but I still wanted the page to have that content rendered on server so I opted for client side rendering on any view paste pages.\n\n## Steps\n### Replacing React Router with `next/router`\nNext.js uses a file-based routing system rather than routes-as-code approach that React Router takes. I decided to first convert the new paste page as that would be completely SSG. Luckily, I had originally structured my React components into a `pages` folder so pulling out that component into a page wasn't terrible.\n\nI wasn't super certain of how SSR worked right off the bat so I first played with the `/raw/:paste` page first before tackling the comparatively more scary `/:paste` page with password handling and actual error handling. \n\n```jsx\n// old CSR\nconst Raw = ({hash}) =\u003e {\n   const { err, result } = useFetchPaste(hash)\n   return \u003cRawText\u003e{result?.content || err}\u003c/RawText\u003e\n}\n\nexport default Raw\n\n// new SSR\nexport async function getServerSideProps(ctx) {\n  // ctx.params.hash allows us to access the slug (the :paste part of the url)\n  const data = await resolvePaste(ctx.params.hash)\n  return { props: { ...data } }\n}\n\nconst Raw = ({error, data}) =\u003e {\n  return \u003cdiv\u003e\n    {/* Only load title/description metadata if no error */}\n    {!error \u0026\u0026 \u003cNextHead data={data} /\u003e}\n    \u003cRawText\u003e\n      {/* Just render the content if it exists, otherwise render the errror */}\n      {data?.content || error}\n    \u003c/RawText\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n}\n\nexport default Raw\n```\n\nThe biggest part I needed to wrap my head around was the `getServerSideProps` async function. I didn't realize that the only job that `getServerSideProps` actually does, is fetch data and pass that data as props to your actual component. Once that clicked, the rest of the refactoring went relatively smoothly.\n\nI had to refactor my `useFetchPaste` hook to just fetch data and then delegated the responsibility of state and password validation shenanigans to whatever component. I ended up changing the name to `resolvePaste` as it no longer followed the [Rules of Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html).\n\nIn hindsight, I probably should've done this step incrementally using something like [Next.js's rewrite rules](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/rewrites) to gradually transition ctrl-v from React Router to Next.js. Luckily I didn't have that many pages to migrate but this is good to know for the future.\n\n### `styled-components` and theme provider\nFrom what I've seen, Next.js doesn't play nicely with `styled-components` out of the box. Throughout the entire previous step, I was looking at painfully broken CSS. Turns out you need to [install an additional Babel plugin](https://styled-components.com/docs/tooling#babel-plugin) to add SSR support to `styled-components`. Then, I added a custom `Document` to `pages/_document.js`. This code augments the root `\u003chtml\u003e` tag of our application which will allow us to inline our CSS styles. \n\n```jsx\n// shamelessly stolen from\n// https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/master/examples/with-styled-components/pages/_document.js\nimport Document from 'next/document'\nimport { ServerStyleSheet } from 'styled-components'\n\nexport default class StyledDocument extends Document {\n  static async getInitialProps(ctx) {\n    const sheet = new ServerStyleSheet()\n    const originalRenderPage = ctx.renderPage\n\n    try {\n      ctx.renderPage = () =\u003e\n        originalRenderPage({\n          enhanceApp: (App) =\u003e (props) =\u003e\n            sheet.collectStyles(\u003cApp {...props} /\u003e),\n        })\n\n      const initialProps = await Document.getInitialProps(ctx)\n      return {\n        ...initialProps,\n        styles: (\n          \u003cdiv\u003e\n            {initialProps.styles}\n            {sheet.getStyleElement()}\n          \u003c/div\u003e\n        ),\n      }\n    } finally {\n      sheet.seal()\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAs I was also using theme provider from `styled-components`, I needed a way to wrap the ThemeProvider component around everything. Luckily a custom `App` created by adding a `pages/_app.js` will allow us to do just that. This also allows us to add any 'global' structure like padding or margins around the edges.\n\n```jsx\nimport ThemeProvider from \"../theme/ThemeProvider\";\nimport GlobalStyle from \"../theme/GlobalStyle\";\n\nconst Main = styled.div`\n  margin-top: 10vh;\n  padding: 0 20vw 30px 20vw;\n`\n\nconst App = ({ Component, pageProps }) =\u003e (\n  \u003cThemeProvider\u003e\n    \u003cGlobalStyle /\u003e\n    \u003cHead\u003e\n      \u003ctitle\u003ectrl-v | a modern, open-source pastebin\u003c/title\u003e\n    \u003c/Head\u003e\n    \u003cMain id=\"appElement\"\u003e\n      \u003cComponent {...pageProps} /\u003e\n    \u003c/Main\u003e\n  \u003c/ThemeProvider\u003e\n)\n\nexport default App\n```\n\n\n### State caching for password pastes\nThis part stumped me for a good bit. I needed to find a way to do an initial data fetch, check to see if the paste has a password, prompt the user for a password, then reload the page data. I contemplated using [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) for data fetching but realized in the shower that it wouldn't really make sense as the initial load is handled in the `getServerSideProps` function anyways. I realized the best way forward was to fetch the initial state in `getServerSideProps` then store it as a React State so I can update it when a password is entered and data is re-fetched. This way there are no page reloads to disrupt user experience and keeps code change minimal. \n\n```jsx\n// simplified version of pages/[hash].js\nexport async function getServerSideProps(ctx) {\n  const data = await resolvePaste(ctx.params.hash)\n  return { props: { ...data } }\n}\n\nconst ViewPaste = ({data, unauthorized, error}) =\u003e {\n  const router = useRouter()\n  const { hash } = router.query // equivalent to ctx.params.hash\n  const [enteredPass, setEnteredPass] = useState('');\n  const [correctPass, setCorrectPass] = useState(!unauthorized);\n  const [clientData, setClientData] = useState(data)\n  const {content, language, expiry, title} = clientData;\n\n  const getWithPassword = (password, errorCallback) =\u003e {\n    resolvePaste(hash, password)\n      .then(resp =\u003e {\n        setCorrectPass(true)\n        setClientData(resp.data)\n      })\n      .catch(e =\u003e errorCallback(e.response.data))\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n      {!error \u0026\u0026 \u003cNextHead data={data} /\u003e}\n      ...\n      \u003cPasteInfo\n        hash={hash}\n        lang={language}\n        theme={theme}\n        expiry={expiry}\n        err={unauthorized ? '' : error}\n      /\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  );\n}\n\nexport default ViewPaste\n```\n\n### Deployment\nGreat! At this point, everything was working great -- locally. Every developer knows just how much of a leap it is to go from local machine to hosted and on the cloud. Right?\n\nMy first thought was to see how difficult it would be to port my existing frontend on Firebase Hosting to run using Next.js instead. Turns out I would've needed to enable Firebase Functions and to do that I needed to enable the Blaze plan (pay as you go). Seeing just [how much of a hassle the process was](https://dev.to/rowaxl/what-i-struggled-with-next-js-using-firebase-hosting-and-enable-ssr-4e67) made me look for other alternatives. \n\nVercel really surprised me with how easy it was to get setup. All I had to do was signup for Vercel using my GitHub account and select a repository to import. It took a total of 5 minutes to go from GitHub repo to deployed website which was a first.\n\nFunnily enough, the hardest part of this entire deployment process was deleting the old frontend off of Firebase. I accidentally deleted the entire project (including my Cloud Run deployed backend) twice and quite nearly misconfigured my domain.\n\n## Impact\nAll in all, trading 6 hours for such a huge quality-of-life improvement on a project that I personally use a lot has been absolutely worth it. To list a few tangible improvements:\n\n* Smoother user experience (no more annoying 'loading paste...' messages)\n* Cleaner codebase\n* Better link previews (sending links to friends)\n  \nIf you haven't had the chance to try Next.js out for yourself and you've made it this far, you owe it to yourself to at least give it a shot. Thanks to the HackClub community (specifically [Rishi](https://rishi.cx/), [Safin](https://safin.dev/), and [Ani](https://anirudhb.github.io/)) for their constant encouragement and criticism of my 'outdated' tech stack.\n\n**Source Code**: https://github.com/jackyzha0/ctrl-v\n\n**Try it out for yourself**: https://ctrl-v.app/",

    "title": "Digital Gardening",
    "content": "\n\u003e As of 2021, this process is no longer accurate. I've embraced a much more networked form of note taking which I've written about [here](posts/networked-thought.md).\n\nThe first image that comes to my head when I hear the word 'gardening' is of a small plot with some leafy greens sprouting their heads from an earthy bed. A gardener tenderly shovels and removes unwanted weeds and pours water to nourish the plants he wants to grow. He takes care to make sure the soil isn't too wet and that each plant has ample space to grow. When the time comes, he harvests each fruit and vegetable and makes sure to plant seeds so that he can repeat the process anew in a few weeks time.\n\nA garden is a metaphor for a lot of things: growth, persistence, and the constant battle against entropy.\n\nWhen I talk about digital gardening, I don't mean digital gardening in the Stardew Valley or FarmVille sense. I mean gardening as in the tending and growth of my own ideas and projects on my own little plot of the world wide web -- namely through my [[thoughts/writing|writing]], notes, and projects. After reading Joel Hook's blog post on his own [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden), I've been thinking and reflecting on my own processes for managing my own digital garden (which you are on right now).\n\n## The garden plot\nAccording to [GitHub](https://github.com/jackyzha0/blog/commit/74f7460c49a7c56acfadf3f8f1cdd892005ebed4), I first created this blog in late August of [2020](posts/2020.md). At the time, it was more of a novelty thing. I wanted to get off of Medium and onto my own platform where I had more fine-grained control over how I could present my work and how people discover it.\n\nI spent a few hours building out my own Hugo theme, making it as frictionless as possible to write produce new content. I threw up a few of my old Medium blog posts just to see how it would look, and I was happy with it. However, even with the novelty of the blog, I had nothing to write about.\n\nThe plot was there; I just didn't have anything to plant in it.\n\n![The Garden Plot](/posts/images/digital-gardening/plot.png)\n\n## Planting the seeds\n\nIf you have no seeds in your garden, the only things that will grow are weeds. I could barely remember the last time I read a book on my own time. Needless to say, garbage in, garbage out.\n\nOver the summer, I began to read again. Technical write-ups, fiction novels, traversing into self-help, and memoirs. I started to read more about the state of the world and critically discuss these with family and friends. Reading helped me colour in the lines as to why we need to build in the first place. I started to realize that the problems we try so hard to solve with technology are not actually tech problems, but inherently human ones.\n\nI've started to write more about some these ideas (like within this blog post!), at first to help me organize my own thoughts, but eventually segued into an excuse for me to talk to people about interesting ideas and get their perspective. It's started a sort of chain reaction, with observations from a book leading to a conversation with a friend to a blog post ad infinitum. I've been able to slowly build up my [base of knowledge](/posts/collaborative-thinking) so that I can contribute meaningfully to conversations.\n\nThese are the seeds I plant in my garden, but these seeds will stay seeds unless watered.\n\n![Planting the seeds](/posts/images/digital-gardening/seeds.png)\n\n## Watering the plants\n\nI have a Notion page of random thoughts and ideas. Whenever I come across something interesting in a conversation or book or article, I file it away in this Notion page. Slowly, categories have appeared as blog posts, articles, and papers coalesce and self-organize.\n\nThis input of information -- the water -- is what allows the ideas to grow. Just as it's not enough to just water a plant once and forget about it, I've found that in-taking information inconsistently is about as good as not doing it at all. To be an effective watering can, I need to be intentional and consistent with my watering.\n\nMy process of collecting random scraps of information first sprung up from coming across interesting blog posts on Reddit. I'd always just read a cool post, follow a few hyperlinks, nod to myself and say \"huh\", and maybe forward it to a friend or two. While it may have been entertaining to read, I got no value out of it. Now that I've started cultivating this garden of ideas, I have a reason to be more intentional in how I sift through the information and be more mindful of what I'm actually taking away from each piece. [[thoughts/writing|Writing]], specifically on this blog and on my newsletter (which you can subscribe to at the bottom of this page), has helped me to go back to more mature ideas and condense and refine them into something presentable and legible to others -- quite literally picking the fruit of my labour. \n\n\u003e We are all constantly bombarded with information, a lot of it is really good information too, but the challenge is absorbing it and applying it to the context of our lives and careers. \u0026mdash; Joel Hooks\n\nNow that I have all of these new-found ideas and tidbits of information, what do I do with them? Keep growing them forever? At some point on the [exploit explore](thoughts/exploit%20explore.md) tradeoff, this knowledge should be applied to something in order to manifest it into something useful. The problem is, which ideas get priority of my time and effort?\n\n![Watering the plants](/posts/images/digital-gardening/watering.png)\n\n## Pulling weeds\n\nNo garden has unlimited space or nutrition to go around. Maybe you have a bigger garden than most, but that doesn't mean you can grow whatever you want silly-willy. Some will need more space than others and others you simply just cannot grow in the same garden plot.\n\nSimilarly, no one has unlimited time and energy they can put into projects and learning. I, unfortunately, have yet to fully learn this lesson. After having an empty plot for so long, having a little greenery show up has inspired me into a planting frenzy, trying to cram as much into the garden as possible.\n\nI'm starting to step back and reflect on my current commitments and deciding to either to step down from things that I'm less passionate about to make more time and room to double down on the things I'm truly passionate about.\n\n![Pulling weeds](/posts/images/digital-gardening/weeds.png)\n\n## End\n\nNone of what I do is perfect. Looking back at writing from a year ago, reading code from a few months ago even, makes me cringe a little. Like any garden, this one evolves and grows over time; there is no 'end-state' that I'm trying to get the garden to. This little garden is just a little place for me to experiment, to push out things that I'm working on, and to provide snapshots of all the in-progress things going on in my life.\n\nThrough tending to this garden [in public](thoughts/building%20in%20public.md), I hope to show my success, failures, and everything in between and offer it as an open garden to learn from for anyone who stumbles upon it in the future. If just one person is inspired by it, learns from a mistake I made, or builds off of my work, then I would consider this garden a success.\n\nMaybe you'll find this as an incentive to start your own.",

    "title": "Docker Explained",
    "content": "\nContent from my own ['Docker Explained' repo](https://github.com/jackyzha0/docker-explained). Check out the repository for example code!\n\n## Introduction\n### What is Docker?\nDocker is a tool that makes it really easy to package applications into self-sustaining 'containers'.\n\n### What are containers?\nContainers, as their name suggests, contain things. In the case of Docker, these contain all the parts the application needs to run, everything from libraries and dependencies to the actual source code.\n\n### Why containers?\nContainerization means that everything to do with your application stays inside the container. You shouldn't need to worry about how stuff on your machine (e.g. which version of Python you have) affects how your program runs. As a side benefit, this means that Docker containers are dependency-free. Never worry about \"oh, it works on my machine\" ever again! After a Docker image is created, all of its contents are frozen so it should work exactly the same on your computer as it does for someone else (assuming you both have Docker).\n\n### Why Docker?\nDocker makes it super easy to work with these containers and, by proxy, you can get all the cool benefits of containers easily too! It also allows you to programmatically define a container through code, meaning you can collaborate and work on Docker containers just as you would with a regular piece of code through version control like `git`.\n\n## Installing Docker\nMore detailed instructions can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).\n\n## Parts of Docker\n### Docker Containers\nI think the intro covered this pretty well so I'll repeat it again here.\n\n\u003e Containers, as their name suggests, contain things. In the case of Docker, these contain all the parts the application needs to run, everything from libraries and dependencies to the actual source code.\n\nThis means that 'containerized' applications don't need to rely on a system to have certain dependencies (e.g. `Node.js`) installed on the user's system to run because the container will have it packaged.\n\nYou can think of Docker containers like a fully self-contained and running version of your application.\n\n### Docker Image\nYou can think of Docker images like a sort of 'template' that describes to Docker how to create a container from scratch. You can build these images by providing instructions on how to build them in the form of layers.\n\n### Layers\nDocker images, like ogres (or cakes if you're a boring person), have many layers. The base layer often provides some basic functionality like providing `git`, `bash` or `apt` -- otherwise your container has nothing to run off of! We can then add our own layers on top of that base layer, like installing dependencies, copying files into the image, and defining the command to run when the container starts up. These instructions are programmatically defined through a Dockerfile.\n\n\u003e One of the coolest parts of Docker is that these layers get cached between builds if nothing has changed. That means that if you rebuild an image and only changed the last layer, it'll only need to rebuild the last layer rather than rebuilding the whole image, making for some really fast iteration times.\n\n### Dockerfile\nThe Dockerfile are the actual specific instructions for how to create the actual image or 'template'. The Dockerfile starts off by defining a 'base-layer', which serve as the basis for your actual image. Some common base layers are `ubuntu` (which contains a minimal install of the actual Ubuntu operating system) and `python` (which contains everything needed to run a basic Python app). \n\nI won't dive into too much details about each command you can use as these will be described more in-depth within the examples. You can find detailed documentation on the commands you can use in a Dockerfile here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/\n\n## Docker CLI\nGreat, so now I know a little bit about how Docker actually works, how do I get started? First, let's make sure our Docker install works correctly. You can do this by opening your favourite terminal and entering `docker run hello-world`. You should get something that looks like:\n\n```bash\n$ docker run hello-world\n\nHello from Docker.\nThis message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.\n...\n```\n\nNow, let's go over a few basic CLI commands that you'll probably be using as you work with Docker.\n\n### `docker build`\n\u003e How do I turn a Dockerfile into an actual image? \n\nTo built an image, you can do `docker build . -t \u003cname-of-image\u003e` which tells Docker to look in the current directory for a file called `Dockerfile` and to follow the instructions inside to build an image. After doing so, tag the image so we can easily find it later. Docker image tags let you version your images as well. Say you wanted to build a v1 for your image, you would do `docker build . -t \u003cname-of-image\u003e:v1`. If you have a different name for your Dockerfile, you can also refer to it using the `-f` flag like so: `docker build . -t \u003cname-of-image\u003e -f \u003cname-of-dockerfile\u003e`\n\nMore info can be found here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/\n\n### `docker image ls`\n\u003e How do I get a list of all the images I've built?\n\nThe command will give you an output that looks something like the following.\n\n```bash\nREPOSITORY                 TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE\nimage1                     0.1.1               9eb95c7f06b0        2 days ago          343MB\nimage2                     \u003cnone\u003e              c99ac06cf60a        2 days ago           23MB\n...\n```\n\nMore info can be found here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/image_ls/\n\n### `docker run`\n\u003e How do I create a container from an image?\n\nNow that you've built an image, you can just run it by doing `docker run \u003cname-of-container\u003e:\u003cversion\u003e`. More often than not, you can just use the latest version of the image, `docker run \u003cname-of-container\u003e:latest`. However, certain applications (like servers) need to listen on specific ports. By default, Docker doesn't allow containers to use ports on your local machine, but you can allow this by specifying ports using the `-p` flag, `docker run -p \u003chost-port\u003e:\u003ccontainer-port\u003e \u003cname-of-container\u003e`. If your container listens on port 3000, but you want it to appear as port 5000 on your local machine, it would look like `docker run -p 5000:3000 \u003cname-of-container\u003e`\n\nIf you want to run your container in the background in a detached manner, you can just add the `-d` flag.\n\nMore info can be found here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/\n\n### `docker ps`\n\u003e How do I figure out what containers are currently running?\n\nYou can get a list of currently running containers by doing `docker ps`, which will give you each container running along with details about its Container ID, what image it was created from, when it was created, as well as which ports are open.\n\n### `docker exec`\n\u003e How do I run a command inside a container?\n\nYou can use the command `docker exec -it \u003ccontainer name\u003e /bin/bash` to get a bash shell in the container, allowing you to run commands from within the container as if it was a full-fledged machine. If you know specifically what command you want to execute, you can use `docker exec -it \u003ccontainer name\u003e \u003ccommand\u003e` to execute whatever command you specify in the container.\n\n## Docker Examples\n1.

What's all the hype about? Basically, its the [single responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle) but applied to services. This means that each responsibility should, ideally, be split out into its own service and be completely responsible for that one thing. This lends itself really easily to Docker and containers. Kubernetes is a system that makes it really easy to deploy, scale, and manage a bunch of containers, making it near ideal in creating a microservices architecture using Docker.\n* https://microservices.io/\n* https://medium.com/hashmapinc/the-what-why-and-how-of-a-microservices-architecture-4179579423a9\n* https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/\n* https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/\n* https://opensource.com/article/17/11/getting-started-kubernetes\n\n## Deploying to the Cloud\nNow that you got some cool new containers? How do I run them in the Cloud like all the other cool kids? Thankfully, Docker makes this super easy too.\n\n### Google Cloud Run (GCR)\n\u003e https://cloud.google.com/run\n\nGCR completely manages scaling and deploying your containers for you so you don't need to worry about server management (yay serverless)! Simply upload your images to Google Container Registry, and create a new Cloud Run deployment.\n\n* https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/prebuilt-deploy\n* https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/build-and-deploy\n\n### Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)\n\u003e https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine\n\nWant to run your own Kubernetes cluster and have a lot of money to burn? GKE may be right for you! Other than the price, GKE is super user friendly and makes it really easy to manage and visualize your deployments.\n\n### Amazon Fargate\n\u003e https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/\n\nThink GCR but Bezos.\n\n* https://medium.com/@ariklevliber/aws-fargate-from-start-to-finish-for-a-nodejs-app-9a0e5fbf6361\n\n# Closing\nI hope you learned a thing or two about Docker! If you found anything the be incomplete, poorly explained, or just garbage, feel free to open an issue about it (and maybe even make a PR improving it)!

    "content": "\n## The 'Involution' of Hackathons\n![A late night breakthrough on our PennApps XX Project](/posts/images/hackathons/drone.png)*A late night breakthrough on our PennApps XX Project*\n\n\u003e \"Quick, quick, Caden! Wake up -- the drone is **flying**!\"\n\nHalf of our team had been sleeping for the past hour and a bit. Acceptable, considering the time was now 2:42 am. The drone was whirring midair in our little room, nearly getting snagged on our laptops, chargers, and free event swag. Beside us, a blackboard wall displayed a rough chalk diagram of our technical architecture. We had roughly 20 hours left in the hackathon and now that the drone worked, our biggest roadblock was out of the way — it was time to build! We grabbed a plate of cold noodles from the meal line and ran past the crowd of people doing cup stacking competitions, karaoke, and Smash tournaments.\n\nThere is something truly special about being able to manifest an idea into reality, that's what pulled me into hackathons in the first place. Anytime I went to a hackathon not knowing anyone, I left with a new group of friends and mentors and a handful of new skills. I've learned a sizeable amount of my technical knowledge through workshops and hackathon projects. These events inspired me to be intellectually curious. To this day, they're the main reason why I still to this day spend hours tinkering on projects and exploring new ideas.\n\nIn comparison, something feels different about the vast majority of hackathons held today. Recent hackathons may have all the bells and whistles of earlier events, featuring elaborate meal plans and free bubble tea, but it feels performative at best. When asking most people about why they want to go to a hackathon, most people will mention something about the prizes, the recruiting, or the free t-shirts with company logos plastered over them. There is an unavoidable corporate air to the events.\n\nHowever, this transition goes much further back than just the past few years. The origin of the more 'modern,' corporate hackathons arose out of corporate spaces like Facebook, which coopted design spaces like hackathons to further their hiring pipelines or to maintain their outward appearance being 'cool' to work for.[^1]\n\nThis corporate co-optation of hacker culture at hackathons has been on the back of my mind ever since reading the chapter on design sites in [*Design Justice*](thoughts/Design%20Justice.md) by Sasha Costanza-Chock. As someone who first got their footing in computer science through hackathons, it pains me to see that this is the rep that hackathons have slowly gotten over time, moving from safe spaces for idea exploration to increasingly corporate, competitive events where hackers spin up apps to test company products in exchange for the slim chance of winning prizes and recognition.\n\nHow did we get here?\n\n## Hacker Culture\nThe hacker subculture formed mainly out of the collaborative (and often competitive) DIY ethic of the [counterculture](thoughts/From%20Counterculture%20to%20Cyberculture.md) of the 1960s. This was the generation of the '[Hackers](thoughts/Hackers.md),' those interested in figuring things out as they go and invented for the *pure ecstasy of building and learning new things*. As Steven Levy defines it, 'hacks' were projects undertaken by these hackers not to fulfill any sort of end goal other than to take pleasure from working on it.[^2]\n\nThe congregation of hackers eventually led to the creation of alternative design and hackerspaces like hackathons. These very first hackathons were gatherings of excited groups of people ready to build something cool over the weekend.\n\nThese spaces were described as originally being \"third spaces\" outside of the influence of the state and the capitalist market.[^3] Yet, without intentional intervention, it is difficult for these design spaces to even uphold their claim as spaces for intellectual exploration for all, as they become dominated mostly by the privileged to expend free time and income, and overrun by corporations clamouring to sponsor hackathons in order to get as much cheap testing on their products as possible, shoving discount code after free credits at each hacker.\n\n**These design sites used to be valorized as places of learning, making, and building. Why then, have they become increasingly corporate places of extraction of free labour?**\n\n## [Incentive](thoughts/incentives.md) Structure of Hackathons\n![Stacks of hackathon stickers ready for hackers' laptops](/posts/images/hackathons/swag.jpg)*Stacks of hackathon stickers ready for hackers' laptops*\n\nIt takes money to run events. Providing an adequate venue, food, internet, and power are not free resources. Yet, with the exception of a few corporate hackathons, the majority of hackathons remain free for attendees. To accomplish this, most hackathon organizers decide to try to acquire monetary sponsorships, food partnerships, and in-kind sponsorships in order to offset costs.\n\nAs a result a viscious cycle forms:\n1. Sponsors try to maximize the benefits they get for their money (e.g. hosting workshops, hiring booths, keynote speakers, company branding)\n2. With more money, hackathon organizers increase the size and scope of the event, leading to more hackers\n3. Hackers see sponsors as increasingly quintessential to the hackathon experience, being a key reason why hackers attend the events (sponsor prizes, free merch, hiring opportunities, etc.)\n4. Repeat\n\nThis leads to some key downstream effects on hackathon culture.\n\n### Prize Incentives\n\u003e \"People are now prioritizing their projects for the dollar value of prizes and the clout of awards. There is a trend where more and more attendees no longer come in to learn and make memories. Teams are now arriving to hackathons fully formed, with an idea in hand, and a checklist of the prizes they want to win.\" -- [Jonathon Xu](https://jonathanxu.com/blog/2020-07-25-on-hackathons)\n\nIncreasingly so, hackathons have placed more emphasis on prizes rather than building. They prominently display the total value of prizes available to entice hackers to attend, tout the available prizes again at opening ceremonies, and repeatedly blast announcements on them during hacking hours. Even DevPost, the 'homepage' for hackathons, organizes hackathons by how much there is to reap. Then again, who wouldn't want a free iPad and tens of thousands in cash prizes and online subscriptions?\n\n![DevPost Top Hackathon categories by prize pool](/posts/images/hackathons/devpost.png)*DevPost Top Hackathon categories by prize pool*\n\nUnfortunately, this [incentive](thoughts/incentives.md) structure attracts people to hackathons for the wrong reasons. Individuals are motivated to tick boxes on a judging rubric rather than to learn and build new skills on a solid foundation; people who *are* there to learn are pushed to try and compete for prizes instead. Beginners, who may have wanted to just learn how to build a website, are instead cajoled into unsustainably trying to learn how to build something completely out of their skill range, becoming frustrated and losing sleep in the process. This is not to say that pushing hackers outside of their comfort range is a bad thing, but there is a limit to how much useful knowledge is retained after patching together APIs and blindly copying tutorials.\n\nThese incentive structures push hackers to tailor projects specifically for prizes to see just how many sponsor prizes they can shotgun for. In most of these cases, hackers don't dare build outside of their comfort zone, instead choosing to work with technology they are already familiar with or project ideas they know have been successful in the past (don't say you haven't seen a gamifying volunteering or smart garbage bin hack before).\n\n### Short Term Optimization\n\u003e \"A one day hack for homelessness takes away from the complexity of social justice issues… you can't just come up with an app that solve the world's problems\" -- Design Justice[^3]\n\nMost hackathon projects are unsustainable and are unlikely to be used or continued to be worked on outside of the hackathon. A lot of this practice arises out of the Silicon Valley [saviorism problem](https://www.stanforddaily.com/2018/02/16/silicon-valleys-saviorism-problem/) and \"[move fast and break things](thoughts/move%20fast%20and%20break%20things.md)\" attitude. [^7] \n\nThe problem with this approach is that it becomes incredibly reductionist. Hacks nearly always focus on problems and rarely build on existing knowledge and work in the field, often ignoring important context about the issues they so readily reduce to a single web app. Ever seen an app claiming to solve the fentanyl crisis or healthcare for the elderly? People think hackathons can do things that they usually can't, such as solve global problems, create new products overnight, or 'level the playing field' of innovation through meritocracy.[^3]\n\nHackathons, as they stand today, seem to optimize for short term excitement, and not so much for long term benefit. But this short-term burst of new products and ideas is exactly what corporations need to fuel their endless hunger for products, testing, and new talent.\n\n## Corporate Cooptation\n\n![Cupstacking, a commonplace hackathon activity](/posts/images/hackathons/cooptation.jpg)*Cupstacking, a commonplace hackathon activity*\n\nCompanies realized that the attendees of these design spaces would *readily* give up their free time to build potentially marketable products. If hackers so readily built things in their own time, why couldn't we co opt these for the company? Hackers provided a source of interesting ideas that could be milked, and, as a result, the creative outputs of these hackerspaces were \"suddenly highly acclaimed, applied, and copy-pasted into capitalist developing laboratories.\"[^5]\n\nThe free market has warped the hacker ethos and hackerspaces into something almost unrecognizable from what it was supposed to stand for. This set of values which may have worked well for small startups or individuals just doesn't scale well for an entire industry. Sharon Zukin and Max Papadantonakis in their work *Hackathons as Co-optation Ritual* describe three quasi-Orwellian principles that describe this new hacker culture: Work is Play, Exhaustion is Effervescent, and Precarity is Opportunity.[^1]\n\n### Work is Play\n\u003e \"Forget about work-life balance. It's all about work-life _integration._ Why else would the office have on-site acupuncture, nap pods, and free dinner after 7 pm?\" -- [Arielle Pardes, WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/how-silicon-valley-ruined-work-culture)\n\nThe initial hacker ethos of wanting to 'innovate' was evident in how vehemently startups disowned the 9-to-5 cubicle life. Walk into any tech company office building and you'd barely be able to tell if it was supposed to be a corporate office or adult playground with all the ping pong tables and colourful decor. The expectation was for employees to treat coworkers as family, office as home, and work as play.\n\nBut this playful front is not exactly as it seems. A [2017 study](https://businessresearcher.sagepub.com/sbr-1863-102641-2779724/20170508/more-companies-offering-unlimited-time-off) by Sage Business Researcher found that employees who work in offices with these benefits tend to stay in the office longer after work, pushing individuals to spend more and more of their lives in the office. Corporations frame events like hackathons as fun events to attend in an effort to appeal to the hacker ethos and to maintain their public image of 'coolness'. Disguised under the nerf gun fights, ping pong tables, and free food is a more sinister intent to treat work as play. Is it wrong to love what you do and treat it as play? No, but corporations shouldn't conflate the hacker ethos with a willingness to 'play' at work.\n\n### Exhaustion is Effervescent\n\u003e \"There are way easier places to work, but nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week\" -- [Elon Musk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1067173497909141504)\n\n100 hour work weeks and 'hustle culture' are becoming increasingly normalized by tech moguls like Elon Musk. Being constantly tired is somewhat of a [status icon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_o7qjN3KF8U) as individuals boast about how little sleep they got.\n\nIt has been disturbingly normalized and even celebrated that [exhaustion is a sign of strength](thoughts/pain.md). Among a [global sleep-loss pandemic](https://www.theguardian.com/business-to-business/2017/dec/04/clocking-off-the-companies-introducing-nap-time-to-the-workplace), events like hackathons which push for attendees to stay up for lengths of 24 to 36 hours are particularly worrisome.\n\nI am viscerally reminded of sharing a hard gym floor with dozens of other sleep-deprived hackers, taking shifts to sleep so some people can stay up to work on the hack. Despite the timeboxed nature of hackathons, there is no reason purposefully staying up all night should be quintessential to the hackathon experience.\n\nPhysical and mental health should not be \"instrumentalized in service of being useful to a startup mission, or even a life philosophy.\"[^7] These events set the precedence of what the next generation of engineers, builders, and designers consider as 'normal' for the industry. Why are we saying that it's okay to prioritize 'success' above personal wellbeing?\n\n### Precarity is Opportunity\nThe startup and hustle culture heavily idolizes those who live precarious lifestyles. *High risk, high reward*. The industry has normalized high turnover rates and job-hopping, with companies like Google and Amazon reporting median tenures of around a year, compared to the national average of 4.1 years.[^6]\n\nToday, the majority of tech employment consists of internships, contract work, short tenures at medium to large companies, and precarious work at startups. Because of the incredulous demand for tech jobs, candidates have considerably more leverage than employers do in offer negotiations, with individuals often using competing offers between companies to renege better signing bonuses and compensation.\n\nWhile not precarious in the traditional labour sense, the employment itself is unstable and temporary. The concept of a 'life-long job' just doesn't exist in this industry. As a result, individuals are constantly asked to market themselves for continually shifting jobs.\n\nSimilarly, these coopted design spaces reshape precarious and unpaid work from exploitative to opportunity. Writing code and building apps for free becomes something to be clamoured and competed over. In other words, \"institutions use the allure of hackathons, with sponsors, prizes, snacks, and potential for career advancement, to get people to work for free.\"[^4]\n\n## Reclaiming Design Spaces\n\n![Liminal spaces: The morning after nwHacks 2020](/posts/images/hackathons/liminal_space.jpg)*Liminal spaces: The morning after nwHacks 2020*\n\nMaybe this is the [death of the hackathon](https://jonathanxu.com/blog/2020-07-25-on-hackathons) as we know it, and that might not necessarily be a bad thing. Maybe we can throw away the focus on prizes, winning, and short-term projects and replace it with something better.\n\n### Sustainable Learning\n\u003e The word hackathon is the portmanteau of *hacking marathon*. Why then, do we treat it like a sprint?\n\nThe 'finish a complete project in two days' mindset of hackathons rarely transfers well into the real world. Realistically, most projects are complex in scope and attempting to reduce complex problems down to a one-weekend hack omits a lot of context and nuance that is often important.\n\nWork done at hackathons should be toward long-term sustainable processes instead of short term precarious work. During the past year, there has been a noticeable uptick in design spaces intended to facilitate longer term work like coliving houses, incubators, and fellowships. Hacker houses like [Edyfi](http://edyfi.org/) and [School 2.0](https://school2point0.com/) give individuals the option to work on existing projects or scale new ones in a supportive community. A few organizations like the Cal Hacks Foundation are pioneering initiatives in this space with programs like the [Cal Hacks Fellowship](https://fellowship.calhacks.io/) (a semester-long idea accelerator that invites teams to build beyond their side-projects) and [Hack Month](https://hackmonth.calhacks.io/) (which is a month-long build-a-thon focused on recentering the fun of building). MLH is also working on non-hackathon initiatives like the [MLH Fellowship](https://fellowship.mlh.io/) and the [Local Hack Day](https://localhackday.mlh.io/) workshops that refocus learning and maintenance rather than just blind creation. I've even noticed more individuals starting larger-scale personal projects that happen on the order of weeks to months rather than single days.\n\nEncouraging the growth of more sustainable skill building enables individuals to take into account a more holistic view of problems. Hopefully, this leads to building longer term, larger scope, and bigger impact projects and skills.\n\n### Places of [play](thoughts/play.md)\nDo we so necessarily need to tie rituals of play in building and tinkering to the recruiting and product testing pipeline for large corporations? Hopefully the answer to that question is no.\n\nYet even today, a majority of communities focused around building like [YCombinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) or [OnDeck](https://www.beondeck.com/) are ultimately not places of play – they have external outcomes they'd like to achieve. We should create dedicated spaces for exploration and learning *without* needing to justify it via some specific outcome. This is not to say that spaces with those goals in mind are bad, but giving individuals the option to have a space for unfettered exploration can give them the freedom to explore ideas that may not have clear monetary value in the short term. Communities like [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/) and [Reboot](https://reboothq.substack.com/) do this particularly well. There is no central 'goal' of trying to launch a product or anything, but rather it's a group of individuals that are intellectually curious and want to learn and build cool things.\n\nThe goal is to provide the infrastructure so that *everyone* can play, not just those privileged enough to throw spare income and time at it. Hackathon organizers shouldn't assume that everyone is able and willing to stay up the entire event and barely set aside enough time for meals. It is important to consider food, bio breaks, accessible bathrooms that are friendly to all body types and genders, comfortable spaces to nap or relax, and decent lighting, etc.[^3]\n\n## Moving Forward\n![A project demo at nwHacks 2020](/posts/images/hackathons/reclaiming.jpg)*A project demo at nwHacks 2020*\n\nIf well-organized, hackathons can provide a fertile ground for pathways to employment as well as being a place of exploration. Those identities don't need to be mutually exclusive. My argument here is that hackathons have recently placed too much emphasis on the pathways to employment; the main focus of design spaces like hackathons should be on hackers, not sponsors. Even for lower-income students, the 'employment' opportunities are usually short-term and precarious. Of course, sponsorship and money does have a role in making these hackathons possible, but not to the scale we've come to expect at these events.\n\n### The Future of Hackathons\nWhat might the future of the hackathon look like, if not what it is now? \n\n* **Emphasis on sustainable learning**. Realistically, hackers will not *learn* if all they did was copy tutorials off the internet. Most learning happens through sharing between individuals and teams. Hopefully, we can bake this into the hackathon structure by creating cohorts of hackers for [parallel play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_play) and refocus the hackathon as a means to [learn and explore](thoughts/Mindstorms.md) for the sake of learning and exploring rather than to hit the checkboxes on a rubric.\n* **Realistic Scoping**. Too many of today's hackathons boast that they focus on creating 'hacks for social good.' The reality of the situation is that these complex and nuanced societal problems *cannot* be solved overnight with a simple web app. Either we stop advertising hackathons for good on the timescale of a single weekend, or we increase the timescale of the hackathon from a weekend to months or even years.\n* **Deprioritization of prizes and winning**. Instead, we should provide a space for hackers to play and explore ideas. Obviously in an ideal world, both can happen at the same time, but the rubric-based approach that most hackathons take make these almost mutually exclusive. For now, let's incentivize participation, completion, and novelty over prizes, competition, and winning.\n* **Hacker-focused spending**. Money spent on often unsustainable swag could be much better spent in favour of more emphasis on higher quality venues, food, and accomodations. In doing so, we can work on raising enough money to run a successful event for the hackers rather than a sponsor's notion of a successful event. At the end of the day, money is power. If you have external [funding](thoughts/funding.md) coming in, the expectation is that they have partial influence over the event. Let's make sure that we draw the line where appropriate with sponsors so that the focus remains on the hacker. \n\n### A Promising Pilot\nThe sudden switch to virtual events due to COVID-19 may actually have been the catalyst to the potential future of hackathons. Virtual hackathons this year have shown how successfully we can run events on low budgets that are often 1/10th of our regular running budget. This means we were able to shave off swag, venue, transportation, and food costs to just a tiny fraction of what they used to be. This taste of what hacker-centric hackathons could be like was incredibly exciting to see, almost a glimpse into what the future of hackathons could look like.\n\n![After HackCamp 2020](/posts/images/2020/post-hc.png)*After HackCamp 2020*\n\nThis year, I was responsible for leading logistics at our beginner-focused hackathon called [HackCamp](https://hackcamp.nwplus.io/). To recentre hackathons around learning and to rebuild a healthier hacker culture, we decided to restructure our event into a virtual conference weekend. Here are a few things we changed:\n\n1. We separated learning and workshops from building and hacking and turned it into a two-day hackathon. This allowed hackers to attend workshops and learn without fear of missing out on precious hacking time and to have scheduled sleeping time between the Learn and Build days.\n2. We replaced our 'top' hackathon project awards with a $25 donation to charity for every project submitted. In the past, we've had feedback from hackers saying how this gave them the confidence to finish a project rather than to fail and give up working on the 'perfect' or 'winning' project.\n3. All events were live streamed. This meant that hackers could do the event on their own time and rewatch important events like opening ceremonies while still providing a 'live' viewing experience for those who are available.\n4. We changed judging to be focused on feedback rather than on evaluation. To do so, we replaced exposition judges (who were normally volunteers or company sponsors) with hackers and did [peer-to-peer](thoughts/peer-to-peer.md) judging. With this approach, each team averaged 7 pieces of feedback.\n\nAlthough this is by no means a full overhaul of the traditional hackathon, we think this is a great pilot into what a more explorative hackathon could look like. We were able to reach over 500+ attendees, 3.2k+ live stream viewers, and over $1200 in donations to charities, and the feedback we got was absolutely stellar.\n\n### Takeaways\nHaving more of the tools to articulate and locate exactly why hackathons have felt increasingly corporate is the first step to reinstate hackathons as third spaces not as places of competition and exploitation, but as places of play and exploration. Hackathons have so much potential to be safe havens for people to find like-minded people away from school assignments or startup grinds or corporate products. \n\nLet's hack the hackathon. This time, with hackers first, not companies. \n\n*Special thanks to Anson, Joice, Ivan, Jasmine, and Jess for reading and helping edit earlier drafts :)*\n\n[^1]: [Hackathons as Co-optation Ritual: Socializing Workers and Institutionalizing Innovation in the \"New\" Economy](https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1575\u0026context=gc_pubs)\n[^2]: [From Counterculture to Cyberculture](https://fredturner.stanford.edu/books/from-counterculture-to-cyberculture/)\n[^3]: [Design Justice: Community-Led Practices To Build the Worlds We Need](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/design-justice)\n[^4]: [*Wired* on Hackathons and Exploitation](https://www.wired.com/story/sociologists-examine-hackathons-and-see-exploitation/)\n[^5]: [Post-it Note City](https://placesjournal.org/article/post-it-note-city)\n[^6]: [*Forbes* on High Turnover Rate in Tech](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinessdevelopmentcouncil/2018/06/29/the-real-problem-with-tech-professionals-high-turnover)\n[^7]: [Beyond Instrumentalization](https://letterstoayoungtechnologist.com/Value-Beyond-Instrumentalization) by Jamie Wang",

    "content": "\n(with insights from Calvin and Hobbes)\n\nSince I’ve started at Hootsuite, I have\n\n* added and/or changed 6223 lines of code in 16 different repos\n\n* closed 24 tickets\n\n* made 4 new Slack emotes\n\n* listened to almost 10,000 minutes of lofi\n\n* had 1 amazing summer at Hootsuite\n\nIncluding the amount of money I’ve spent on lunch this past summer, everything has been so much more than I expected it to be. This short but sweet experience is something that I definitely will remember for a very long time.\n\n![[October 18th, 2015](https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/2015/10/18)](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*uK2cNprrvSGsaECM.jpg)*[October 18th, 2015](https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/2015/10/18)*\n\nOver these short 8 weeks, I’ve learned a lot. Everything at Hootsuite has served to be a once-in-a-lifetime learning opportunity, from learning to build complex services in languages that I’ve never even heard to doing technical demos in front of the entire Product Development team. Despite being a ‘software development’ position, I found myself learning to be a better technical communicator, to have better personal confidence, and so much more.\n\nYet among everything, two big lessons stood out to me:\n\n## The balance of life and work\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*Mj-EMJtcvI4hM_jC.jpg)\n\nPeople often say how elusive good work-life balance is, even to the point of saying that it doesn’t exist. Yet, at my 2 months here at Hootsuite, I can positively say that it is alive and well. We’ve hiked almost 44km across 4 different trails in BC, attended music festivals, and even found niche groups for those interested in bouldering. At the office, there is no shortage of Slack memes and free birthday cake either. On a more serious note, the managers and leads here care deeply about their team members and go out of their way to ensure not only their well-being but also their development as a person.\n\n![Mount Seymour Trail Hike with the team!](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/7936/1*eM_TIZGbBJIz485ssMqKTQ.jpeg)*Mount Seymour Trail Hike with the team!*\n\nThis was a big change from high school where a day at school left me completely drained and just ready to crash. Everything was so focused on grinding for results and doing work that it was hard to make time for myself. At Hootsuite, the community made it feel easy and natural to find the balance that worked for me.\n\nI was still working 8 hours a day, but somehow I felt energized and ready for more each day. It motivated me to make time to take on a freelance web development job just for practice (and to pay rent — living in Vancouver is rough) and even to make a simple project for a friend’s birthday!\n\nI know that this has probably been repeated countless times already, but I cannot stress how important it is to make sure you’re taking enough time off to relax.\n\n## Rejection\n\n\u003e Don’t reject yourself before other people get the chance to\n\n![[December 27th, 1985](https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1985/12/27)](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*Psh-fqFgVeQegGay.jpg)*[December 27th, 1985](https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1985/12/27)*\n\nBecomes sometimes, you just gotta go for it. You probably shouldn’t be going around and ruining nice coffee tables, but it works as a metaphor I guess? The point is: take necessary risks. Don’t say “nah, that’s not possible” before someone else tells you it is. At the start of summer, if someone told me I was going to be doing a demo on a proposal for a massive re-architecture of one of Hootsuite’s core services, I would have told you that you were insane. Yet here I am, doing just that:\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3488/1*P8WSSl993SYILSfw9EfCwg.png)\n\nIf your brain is anything like mine, you often get these nagging self-doubts about whether you’re capable of doing something. The first time I was assigned to help define Service Level Objectives ([SLOs](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/service-level-objectives/)) for some of Hootsuite’s core services, I was shocked.\n\u003e They’re letting a high schooler do this? How am I even close to being qualified?\n\nNot wanting to miss the opportunity, I took it. But as I began work, it became clear that I was the biggest critic in the room. They wouldn’t have asked me to do it if they didn’t trust me to do it and to do it well. Moving forward, I tried to trust myself more and to put myself out there, eventually taking on projects that I never thought would’ve been possible:\n\n* Designing prototype service meshes\n\n* Adding endpoints and writing scripts to cleanup user data\n\n* And other crazy things that I probably can’t publicly disclose\n\nIf an opportunity presents itself, jump on it! You don’t know where it might take you.\n\nIt’s really hard to put in words how much I’ve learned from the Owls here at Hootsuite. To the Owls: hopefully I’ve added something of value to all of you too.\n\n* Thanks to my manager and team lead Imtiaz and Shaun for being absolutely amazing in supporting my whole journey from start to finish.\n\n* Thanks to our team — team Golden Hammer — for helping me realize that yes, work can still be done while having fun. (:harold:)\n\n* Thanks to the co-ops (most notably Kevin, Andy, and Albert) for being so welcoming and having such a wholesome community.\n\n* Thanks to the other high school interns (Chloe, Kai, and Scarlet) for making sure that I wasn’t the only high school student that was being made fun of at board game night.\n\nAnd finally, thanks to Hootsuite for showing this little owl the world!\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/9312/1*RwlvNswSg95J253WHq2zbQ.jpeg)\n\nHootsuite has changed my attitude on how I see the world and it’s beautifully captured in one quote from Waterson —\n\u003e “It’s a magical world, Hobbes, ol’ buddy ... let’s go exploring!”\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*aq1RW9_3MViZBV0b.png)\n",

    "title": "Networked Thought",
    "content": "\n\u003e \"Gardens … lie between farmland and wilderness ... The garden is farmland that delights the senses, designed for delight rather than commodity.\" -- [Bernstein](http://www.eastgate.com/garden/Gardens.html)\n\nWe live in an information age. The amount of data we produce far outweighs what we consume, so much so that it has extended far beyond our ability to make meaningful use of it. Even our modern day [search](thoughts/search.md) systems seem to be falling apart under the stress of today's overwhelming flow of data with the quality of our search engines degrading from all of the SEO hacks, paid advertiser content, and clickbait headlines.\n\nOver the past year, I've slowly found processes that have worked well in creating a little curated corner of the [Internet](thoughts/Internet.md), rich with wonderfully curious people exploring exciting ideas. You may have noticed I merged my blog and digital garden under my main site. A lot has changed since I last wrote about processes in my [Digital Gardening](posts/digital-gardening.md) post and some are no longer accurate. \n\nThis is a v2.\n\n## What is digital gardening?\nA digital garden is not a file cabinet, nor is it fully an index. A digital garden, in fact, is less so a well-kempt plot for farming and more so a mess of entangled growth. It is a network of interconnected ideas and thoughts, clustered by how they are associated with each other.\n\nThis is not because I don't like order, but because I think **a dash of chaos and entropy is good for new ideas**. They help connect two separate ideas that you normally would not have associated with each other, and to imagine the 'what if' more frequently.\n\nMy goal with a digital garden is not purely as an [organizing system](thoughts/organizing%20system.md) and information store, thought it works nicely for that. I want my digital garden to be a playground for new ways ideas can connect together. As a result, existing formal organizing systems like Zettelkasten or the hierarchical folder structures of Notion don't work well for me. There is way too much upfront friction that by the time I think about how to organize my thought into categories, I've lost it.\n\nThis is the problem with the file cabinet: it focuses on efficiency of access and [interoperability](thoughts/interoperability.md) rather than generativity and creativity. Thinking is not linear, nor is it [hierarchical](thoughts/A%20City%20is%20not%20a%20Tree.md). In fact, not many things are linear or hierarchical at all. Then why is it that most tools and thinking strategies assume a nice chronological or hierarchical order for my thought processes? The ideal tool for thought for me would embrace the messiness of my mind, and organically help insights emerge from chaos instead of forcing an artificial order.\n\n## How I garden\n\u003e Digital gardens focus not on being a definite source of truth, but rather a source which is constantly evolving as your own knowledge grows and changes\n\nMy blog made me scared of posting. I was scared of putting things into the public because I was anxious about all the different ways people could perceive it, both in the present and in the future. What if I posted something that people thought was *stupid*? Or worse yet, somebody would see my current work in the future and look down on me for how naive my thinking was. I was scared of [digital permanence](thoughts/digital%20permanence.md).\n\nBut honestly, the more I wrote and just put things out there, the less that line of thinking made sense. The internet is pretty [ephemereal already](thoughts/ephemereal%20content.md). It's hard enough to *willingly* create something people will remember a week from now, let alone for all of eternity. While this is still a non-zero probability, the consistent outpour of support and interesting comments I *did* get from posting made me feel it was worth it.\n\nI still, by and large, write for myself. [[thoughts/writing|Writing]], for me, is a form of [knowledge distillation](thoughts/knowledge%20distillation.md). It helps to clarify my thinking and condense my knowledge so I can easily articulate it to others. If done well, I have a **shareable representation of my thoughts** that I can send out into the world and people can respond. Even for my most half-baked thoughts, this helps me create a feedback cycle to strengthen and fully flesh out that idea.\n\nDigital gardening is not just passive knowledge collection. It's a form of expression and sharing. The goal should be to tap into your network's collective intelligence to create constructive feedback loops, not to post content that 'gains clout' or makes you look smart.\n\n\u003e “[One] who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but [they] also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important.” — Richard Hamming\n\nHere are some learnings over the past year of digital gardening:\n- Link by concept rather than by exact match. I will often explicitly have a `Related: (some concept)` link somewhere if I feel two subjects are closely associated. Linking new knowledge to existing knowledge makes it easy to remember. This has helped me find really cool connections on numerous occasions. \n- Name notes to be as simple as possible. I prefer using verbs or nouns to make it easier to link concepts and thoughts.\n- Good [search](thoughts/search.md) matters a lot. When I search, I usually don't know the exact name of the thing I'm looking for, otherwise, why would I be searching for it in the first place? I use search as an entry-point into a single node, *then* recall by associativity rather than by indexing. But having a good entry-point can make or break my flow into finding what I'm looking for. \n\nThis is still a process I'm refining to this day. Likely, my learnings will have grown by the next time around when I rewrite this again.\n\n## Knowledge Flow\nI don't read everything I come across. I am at a point where I am constantly bombarded with new and interesting things from my Twitter Feed, friends, Slack groups, Discord Servers, Telegram DMs, and so much more.\n\nDespite my manic page parking, I really only get time to read about 30% of content sent my way. Even among those 30%, I probably only have meaningful thoughts and connections with about half of those.\n\nI've started developing a process to better manage my process for information intake.\n\n### Seeds\nI am a person who needs a very low friction way to dump new ideas and things to look at in the future.\n\nI use [Draft](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/draft-by-slite/ljkidlijlaapmiilabpldhmhekeionfh?hl=en) by Slite to have a 'scratch space' in my new tab page where I have my running list of todos, temporary thoughts, and things to read in the next little bit. It's my Apple Notes for my laptop.\n\nI use [Curius](https://curius.app/) to keep a backlog of things that are interesting but not interesting enough for me to read at this exact moment.\n\nActually, on reflection, I tend to generally bookmark things for later then revisit them when I have time. For [projects](thoughts/idea%20list.md), writing, and all sorts of reading. Even when reading books, I don't like to take complex notes right away will only bookmark or highlight phrases. I will eventually come back to the bookmarks a second time to generate insights and actual thoughts. It feels like this weeds out unnecessary noise and provides a natural chance for spaced repetition.\n\nThese are the seeds that form the basis of ideas and thoughts.\n\n### Saplings\nSaplings are single nodes or thoughts. When linking notes, I generally do not silo notes into categories. Sometimes, the presence of specific 'folders' or 'topics' prevents us from making surprising connections between otherwise related topics (e.g. [urban planning](thoughts/urban%20planning.md) and [data structures](thoughts/A%20City%20is%20not%20a%20Tree.md)).\n\n### Fruits\nOf course, a knowledge index isn't much use if it doesn't inform future thinking and output. Fruits are what I like to call derivative or 'new' pieces of content.\n\nIt's the act of creating 'newer' work from saplings, mostly longer form essays, projects, etc. At this stage, thoughts and ideas have matured enough to be able to share and collaborate. Right now,  traditional '[tools for thought](thoughts/tools%20for%20thought.md)' are not great for this aspect, lacking the ability to publish, edit, and share notes with others.\n\n## Start your own\nI've found having my own digital garden has been immensely helpful. It's created a playground for me to experiment with writing, have an excuse to read, learn, and share with others, and be less scared of putting this out into the public.\n\nThrough tending to this garden [in public](thoughts/building%20in%20public.md), I hope to show my success, failures, and everything in between and offer it as an open garden to learn from for anyone who stumbles upon it in the future. If just one person is inspired by it, learns from a mistake I made, or builds off of my work, then I would consider this garden a success.\n\nMaybe you'll find this as an incentive to start your own.\n\n\u003e I'd like digital garden to be like a bonsai tree. Carefully growing, trimming, pruning, artfully shaping a beautiful tree of resources and ideas\n\n![https://www.are.na/block/2175982](/thoughts/images/garden-bird.png)*'Everyone tends his or her own little [epistemological](thoughts/epistemology.md)' garden, growing ideas from seed and sharing them with anyone who comes by.*\n\n[Image Source](https://www.are.na/block/2175982)\n",

    "title": "A New Glossary of Words",
    "content": "\n*This is an expansion of thoughts on [terminology](thoughts/terminology.md) and why we need new words. The following is a dialogue on the original [consensus](thoughts/consensus.md) problem: agreeing on what we mean. You can view the full artifact [here](https://play.jzhao.xyz/new-words).*\n\n---\n\n**Characters**\n- **W:** a wordsmith, a poet, a pluralist \n- **P:** a pedantic\n\n**P:** Why do we need all these words? \n\n**W:** Ah, a question much asked throughout much of history.\n\n**P:** Well no one seems to have a good answer at least. Don't we have enough words to express all we want to express already? There are innumerable ways to combine the words we already do have.\n\n**W:** The whole point of language is to have shared mental models to enable us to communicate complex ideas more easily. There is a form of epistemic injustice known as [hermeneutical injustice](thoughts/hermeneutical%20injustice.md) where one has no labels or common [terminology](thoughts/terminology.md) to describe or explain experiences to others. Clearly, there are not enough words to express the human experience.\n\n**P:** Okay, I admit that new words are useful. But who is to say what each word means? Who is to say that the word 'apple' even refers to the fruit I just ate, or that 'metaverse' is even a real word?\n\n**W:** Language is logically [decentralized](thoughts/decentralization.md), is it not? There is no governing body that determines what a word means. The meaning of a word lies in its use[^1], and that is decided by those who speak the language.\n\n**P:** That is not necessarily true though. The language of the law sets out centralized definitions for words *so* that definitions cannot be swayed or morphed to fit the needs of its wielders. Similarly, at the start of a mathematical proof, one should *always* define the axioms or givens to be agreed upon before attempting to use them in any capacity.\n\n**W:** There seems to be a flaw in your argument. Yes, I agree that a consistent set of definitions is required for any sort of productive knowledge sharing. But you fail to account for **plurality**. [context](thoughts/context.md) modifies meaning.\n\n**P:** Plurality as in a multitude of definitions?\n\n**W:** Precisely.\n\n**P:** Well that is almost certainly problematic as well, is it not? Too many competing definitions cannot be a good thing. We have dictionaries for a reason. How would anyone new to learning English be able to grasp the nuances of all of the meaning and history behind each term? It would get overwhelming incredibly quickly.\n\n**W:** I concede that you have a good point. However, we can take a leaf out of Karl Popper's [^3] book: the *lie-to-children*. We can create simple glossaries and terminological definitions as some abstraction for the larger, more nuanced concepts of the real world.\n\n**P:** Wait... lying is categorically bad is it not?\n\n**W:** Hold on and let me finish my thought. According to Pratchett[^2], \"a lie-to-children is a statement that is false, but which nevertheless leads the child's mind towards a more accurate explanation.\" I think what I'm trying to get at is this concept of [verisimilitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verisimilitude): that there is no binary true or false, [some propositions are more true](thoughts/philosophy%20of%20science.md) than others, especially in context.\n\n**P:** Okay, I accept that taking a toy-model approach to new terminology makes sense. But I still don't understand why we couldn't just have a single definition for each word in this model.\n\n**W:** My concern with a 'standard' library of definitions is that interpretations of concepts are not allowed to adapt to usage over time. How does a dictionary or thesaurus adapt to the historical meaning of racial slurs, for example? Those who hold the ability to rewrite the past are the ones with power. Again, this is why having centrally controlled language is a bad idea. This was quite clear in Orwell's work.\n\nOf course, this is not to say that definitions are not important. In fact, quite the opposite. Definitions hold immense power in shaping how we talk and think about the world writ large. What I am saying is that language needs the ability to evolve on its own. Individuals and groups should have the agency to 'reclaim' harmful and outdated definitions.\n\n**P:** Isn't this exactly *why* we need centralization? This is like Plato's Ship of State[^4]. Any large vessel by their very nature needs to be steered firmly. Those aboard must yield to their captain's commands; no reasonable person believes that a ship can be run democratically.\n\n**W:** Would sailors want to obey a captain who takes them somewhere they don't want to be? No. I imagine language like multiple small ships, each one with its own crew (crew of course, meaning an agreed meaning for a set of definitions). Let me reiterate without the ship metaphor: language requires **localized** [consensus](thoughts/consensus.md) for it to function.\n\n**P:** Ah, now I see that you don't mean complete [decentralization](thoughts/decentralization.md), that makes a lot more sense. I can agree on this. I am, however, curious about how local agreement should propagate to become widely accepted. After all, almost all English speakers can agree and what an 'apple' refers to, yet nobody seems to have a good definition for relatively newer terminology like the 'metaverse'.\n\n**W:** This is an interesting question to think about. Not only do we need to think about spatial locality, but also temporal locality as well. I'd like to think about this in terms of metallurgical annealing if you'd let me.\n\n**P:** As in the process of heating metal to make it more malleable?\n\n**W:** Yes, exactly! Let us imagine definitions of words as metal nodules. After a nodule is heated to a high temperature, it is workable. Similarly, when new terminology is coined, it has a period where it is malleable and adaptive and achieving local consensus is relatively easy.\n\nOf course, over the course of the annealing process, meaning can drift. Centralizing then, is a form of metal hardening and shaping. It anchors meaning and prevents it from being easily modified. Just as one should not have metals be load bearing until they've hardened and been shaped for their specific use case, semantically fluid terms should not be epistemelogically load bearing.\n\nWe imagine new words as small nodules. The size correlates with the number of individuals that agree with the definition. Smaller nodules reach the right temperature for annealing more easily. As the definition becomes more widely accepted, it gains mass and becomes harder to work.\n\n**P:** Sorry, I don't follow this metaphor very well. Could you rephrase?\n\n**W:** I hope you excuse my thinking out loud, but this metaphor has given me the clarity to better express this idea in terms of regular language.\n\nEarly on, achieving local consensus on a definition is rather easy; there are only a handful of people who then know about the term, let alone use it regularly. As the term grows more popular, it becomes increasingly difficult to maneuver and adapt in such a way that the meaning of the term cannot shift very much without causing fracturing.\n\n**P:** Ah that makes a lot more sense. Hmm. This covers the initial semantic definitions for a word but is there any way to change the meaning of a definition after it's been concretized?\n\n**W:** This seems quite difficult for terminology already ingrained within society. Especially as meaning is not dictated by some central organization, any old definitions\nneed to be collectively forgotten. As we concluded earlier, this is incredibly difficult for widely used terms.\n\nAs we enter an age of digital permanency, we should normalize the right to be forgotten for terminology. It should be normal for terminology to be forgotten -- for it to slip through the hands of time like sand.\n\n**P:** This ignores a lot of history, does it not? \"By changing what we were, you change what we are and what we are going to be.\"[^5] This is a form of erasure through terminology change. By 'forgetting' terminology, you deny its existence.\n\n**W:** I may have phrased my words poorly, that was not my intention. Maybe abandoned is a better word? I want to create dictionaries and glossaries that keep terminological history. A sort of 'append-only' record of how terminology has split, died, and evolved over time.\n\n**P:** What do you mean by append only?\n\n**W:** The only way to overwrite an existing definition is to either hard-fork it within a subcommunity or to create entirely new words. Hard-forking involves an agreement from a subcommunity to use an alternative definition for specific terms.\n\n**P:** Well, what words need to start anew? Clearly there are words that could benefit from redefinition.\n\n**W:** The 'metaverse' for one could use a lot of redefinition. Meta has put a lot of effort into claiming and defining this term for their own benefit -- a closed, profit-driven, and attention-farming dystopia. A few groups have cropped up around reclaiming some of this terminology, including one forking John Perry Barlow’s 1996 [Declaration for the Independence of Cyberspace](https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence) as a reaction to Facebook's recent rebranding as Meta.\n\nLikewise, many groups across the world have tried to redefine and hard-fork the definition of 'hacker' for quite some time. Hacking, as known by the general public, generally refers to gaining unauthorized access to technology. Yet within this local hacker subcommunity, a hacker is widely defined as one who builds and creates for the sake of creating.\n\n**P:** I am increasingly convinced by your argument against centralized definitions. I think, as a society, we need to think more critically about language and terminology and how they carry power. We want to enable evolution and creation of new terminology to enable others to have the language to speak of their lived experiences and complex ideas.\n\n**W:** Yes! In fact, I think we need a new approach to building glossaries and dictionaries. At the core of it all, we are hoping to better solve the original consensus problem: agreeing on what each other mean. To abolish the existing centralized dictionaries and glossaries without suggesting an alternative would be in bad faith.\n\n**P:** What sort of alternative are you proposing?\n\n**W:** A collectively curated glossary of sorts. One which involves a rich history and [context](thoughts/context.md) of terms, pluralist in nature, and always ongoing. If meaning is a negotiation, then the history of that negotiation needs to be a crucial part of achieving consensus on the meaning.\n\nLet us create a new glossary of terminology. May it be *a* source of [truth](thoughts/truth.md) rather than *the* source of truth.\n\n[^1]: *Philosophical Investigations*, Ludwig Wittgenstein\n[^2]: *The Science of Discworld*, Terry Pratchett\n[^3]: *The Logic of Scientific Discovery*, Karl Popper\n[^4]: *Republic*, Plato\n[^5]: Martín Becerra on Natalia Denegri",

Nothing stops.* -- [Helena Fitzgerald on Substack](https://griefbacon.substack.com/p/nothing-stops?utm_source=url\u0026curius=1294)\n\n![](thoughts/images/Nothing%20Stops.png)\n\nNone of it. The good times, nor the bad. There is no \"until this is over\", or \"when I'm done this.\" There is no \"when I get less busy\" or \"after this term.\" *Nothing stops.*\n\nThere is one Annie Dillard [quote](thoughts/quotes.md) I hold central to my 'consciousness cannon',\n\n\u003e How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives. \n\nWhat we do with this hour and that one is what we are doing. What can you do to make your hours, days, and life meaningful? Certainly not toiling away for the next few years on things that pain you and question your sanity. Pain is *not* the unit of effort that matters[^4]. Time is.\n\nTake the time to find yourself. Take the time to smell the proverbial flowers. Take a break to sharpen your saw for it will not delay you from cutting more wood.\n\nThere is no permanence to this universe. If we could stop time, we would. Bill Waterson once said that 'If people could put rainbows in zoos, they'd do it'. Everything we build is a sand castle waiting to be washed away at high tide. Yet, I think that's what gives life its beauty.\n\nWhat gives live meaning is its scarcity. If one could live forever and do everything they could ever want, why wouldn't they choose it[^1]? We value the time of others because we know that is finite. Life has meaning because it is finite.\n\nLove then, is *knowingly* choosing the losing side. What is love but the constant battle against entropy that drives everything apart and strips it of its salience? Loving one another is always the process of deluding ourselves into believing in a better world. What greater project is there, in an unbearable time, in a perpetual future, where nothing stops? In a society that never stops, isn't loving the ultimate form of protest? To be able to be whole in your existence, to share your time on this little piece of rock drifting through space together?\n\nCompanionship is valuable because it affords the opportunity to feel 'seen' by another. We can only, according to Nathaniel Braden, view ourselves conceptually but we need others to view ourselves perceptually. Other consciousnesses function like a mirror -- being seen in this way is recognition of personhood. The feeling of being seen is psychological visibility. Love then, is witness through it all.\n\nWitness is deep attention[^5]. To witness is not to tether or to pop their balloon, but to hold their strings carefully. adrienne maree brown described relationships like a spiderweb—diaphanous yet strong, thick yet porous. “A web allows things to fall through, like a sieve,” she said. “Some things are not meant to be caught.” David Whyte believed that the ultimate touchstone of a relationship is not improvement, neither of the other nor of the self. \n\n\u003e \"The ultimate touchstone is witness, the privilege of having been seen by someone, and the equal privilege of being granted the sight of the essence of another, to have walked with them, and to have believed in them, and sometimes, just to have accompanied them, for however brief a span, on a journey impossible to accomplish alone\" -- David Whyte\n\n*Nothing stops* isn't a statement about how nothing matters. Rather, it is a call to spent time on what does matter. As Patti Smith said when discussing William Blake and her creative influences, \"Who are the people, ideas, and books that magnify your spirit? Find them, hold on to them, and visit them often.\"[^3]\n\nIn the lifespan of the universe, how lucky are we to share our lives together? \n\n[^1]: [Nozick's Experience Machine](thoughts/Nozick's%20Experience%20Machine.md)\n[^2]: Bill Waterson\n[^3]: [Patti Smith on Time, Transformation, and How the Radiance of Love Redeems the Rupture of Loss](https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/10/19/patti-smith-m-train-loss-time/)\n[^4]: I've seen a lot of people take interest in [this article by Mark Manson](https://markmanson.net/question) which argues that \"what pain you want in your life\" is a much more defining question than what we want in life. I agree that happiness requires struggle. But struggle for *yourself* and what *you* want. Struggle because it is meaning-laden, not because society demands it and optimizes for the *appearance* of sufferance. I like this anecdote from [alkjash](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bx3gkHJehRCYZAF3r/pain-is-not-the-unit-of-effort) (more thoughts [here](thoughts/pain.md)): \"If it hurts, you're probably doing it wrong... If your wrists ache on the bench press, you're probably using bad form and/or too much weight. If your feet ache from running, you might need sneakers with better arch support. If you're consistently sore for days after exercising, you should learn to stretch properly and check your nutrition.\"\n[^5]: I loved Jasmine's piece on *[attending to the other](https://jasminewang.substack.com/p/attending-to-the-other)* and I consider it a critical part of my consciousness cannon",

    "content": "\n## Making of Open Source software\nI’ve recently made my way through [*Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software*](thoughts/Making%20and%20Maintenance%20of%20OSS.md) by Nadia Eghbal. Not only does it have some absolutely stunning cover art, it also touches on some thoughts that have been marinating in my head about the intersection of open source and [funding](thoughts/funding.md). So much so, that I’ve started experiencing the Baader-Meinhof effect, seeing something to do with open source and funding everywhere I look in tweets, conversations, and blogs.\n\nThis blog post is an exploration of processes in open source, the value it provides, and how money fits into the picture.\n\n![Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software](/posts/images/paid-oss/oss_book.jpg)*Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software*\n\n### How it's made\n\u003e \"Open source developers were frequently characterized as 'hobby' developers, because the assumption was that only companies could make 'real' software.\"[^1]\n\nAs it stands, there are two primary schools of thought about how open source software is created.\n\n1. **Firm-based** production involves companies, organizations, governments, or any institution with centralized resources. Their driving thesis is that only companies make software because, from a coordination standpoint, centralized firms are the most efficient way to manage resources. Most development done this way is motivated extrinsically by means of monetary compensation.\n   \n2. **Commons-based** production is a more vague concept that involves a distributed group of developers that work on a resource that is used, owned, and governed by its own community - free of  employer affiliations. Most development done this way is motivated intrinsically, people do work because they want to do it.\n\nTraditionally, software has been seen as a product of firms. Open source developers were often treated as hobbyists and the projects they made trivialized as toys. The assumption was that only companies could make ‘real’ software. However, the rise of [Internet computing](thoughts/internet%20computing.md) and collaboration tools like Git have decreased the barrier to entry enough that producing software through a commons is now feasible and very much alive. The success of projects like Apache, Linux, and FreeBSD proved just how successful a commons-based method of production could be.\n\nSurprisingly, this may also help to explain why some developers view open source and money as completely separate. If the commons-based method of production is rooted in intrinsic motivation, then money, an extrinsic motivator, will be seen as opposite to core ideals that open source stands for.\n\n\n## [Creation vs Maintenance](thoughts/creation%20vs%20maintenance.md)\n\u003e \"Creation is an intrinsic motivator, maintenance usually requires extrinsic motivation\"\n\u003e\n\u003e @balupton, isaacs/github [#167](https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/167)\n\nWhen an artist finishes a painting, or a runner finishes a marathon, that usually signifies the end of said responsibility. There is no such finish line for an open source project, even after pushing out an initial product.\n\nCreating a project is fun. It’s a wild exploration into a new idea, a frivolous journey to create something useful or to learn something new. As cloud platforms continue to eat the world, the costs of distributing and sharing a project are almost completely nullified.\n\nJust a few clicks and a few taps of your keyboard and your project is readily available to any of the 4.66 billion people around the world with [Internet](thoughts/Internet.md) access. This adrenaline rush of finally releasing the labour of your work onto the world is the moment developers are constantly chasing. For most developers, the process of creation and distribution is intrinsically motivated; it’s an enjoyable process.\n\n[Maintenance is less so.](thoughts/maintenance.md). This is akin to a writer that’s been asked to edit and revise the same book day in and day out, long after they’ve reaped the initial financial and reputational rewards from its creation. Even when the creator wants to leave the project to work on something else, they can’t. They’re tightly shackled by the fact that hundreds of thousands of other organizations, companies, and tools rely on their code to keep their operations running. Bringing on additional developers may not help either, as they still require onboarding, code reviews, and general guidance.\n\nCode may be nearly free to create and distribute, but maintenance is still expensive.\n\n## Types of code\n### Code as an artifact\nThere are two main ways we can look at code. The first of which is *static* code. Code that, on its own, does nothing but exists as an archive. Others can copy and download the code without incurring any additional costs to the author. For the maintainers, it should make no difference in regards to cost whether 10 or 10,000 people use it.\n\nThis type of code is a pool resource or [public good](thoughts/public%20goods.md), it is\n1. **Non-rivalrous.** My ability to copy the code doesn’t affect your ability to copy it. (This isn’t exactly true due to some marginal costs but I’ll discuss this later)\n2. **Non-excludable.** If someone has a copy of the code, it is very difficult to prevent them from sharing that code with others.\n\nAny code that is in this state is easy to share, copy, and distribute. This is the type of code that lives dormant on Github, on StackOverflow answers, and in GitHub’s Arctic Vault[^2]. However, the main purpose of consuming code is not to simply read and study it, but to actually use it and to let it interact with other code.\nIn doing so, we bring it to life.\n\n\n### Code as an organism\n\u003e \"Open source code derives its value not from its static qualities but from its living ones.\"[^1]\n\nAs soon as you hit CTRL-V on that snippet of code, as soon as that static code is inserted into your own, that code comes to life. It might surface  ridiculous amounts of red squigglies, break other code, or force you to rewrite your previous code just to make it work. When code transitions from a resting static state to an active living state, it starts to incur a set of hidden costs.\n\nLike a living organism in a symbiotic relationship, there is a mutual interdependence between it and others in the software ‘ecosystem’ in order to survive. As a result, this ecosystem requires constant upkeep to ensure that components don’t fall out of balance: dependency bumps, documentation updates, and infrastructure changes.\n\n## Free as in speech, not as in beer\n‘Free’ software doesn’t refer to its price. In fact, ‘free’ software is often extremely expensive. As Richard Stallman first described free software, it’s “free as in speech, not free as in beer.” The point Stallman was trying to make was that ‘free’ refers to what one could do with the software, rather than the price tag.\n\n### Latent cost of software\nIn reality, code in its alive state is more like a free puppy. In the beginning, it’s a great and wonderful thing! Super fun and super cute. As it grows and gets older, you realize “geez, it actually takes a lot of my own time to take care of this thing.” Unlike a piece of inanimate furniture, bringing a living creature into one’s home comes with bringing in a new set of responsibilities too.\n\n**Marginal costs** are costs increase on a per-user basis. I mentioned earlier that these costs mean that software is actually rivalrous, meaning that at some point, the project won’t be able to support the n+1th user. Some of this cost comes from physical infrastructure like code hosting and infrastructure. However, the majority of the cost comes from user support. Say you have a billion users and only 0.1% of them require support. If it takes you roughly 10 minutes to resolve each issue, you would still need 20,833 people working 8-hour shifts a day just to be able to keep up with the support volume. Maintainers are constantly wrestling with keeping their issue volume low and questions answered. Eventually, it just becomes a hindrance preventing them from working on the core product.\n\n**Temporal costs** are those which build up and compound over time. Most of it comes from technical debt, choices that are easier today at the expense of time and money in the future. This is the eternal battle against entropy: the inevitable decay of systems over time. When code changes, all the supporting knowledge that surrounds it must be updated too. Documentation, tutorials, programming books, videos, and more slowly become obsolete.\n\nPaying off these latent costs is seldom intrinsically motivated. When people talk about how fun making new projects is or contributing to open source, it’s never referring to writing documentation or refactoring code. This isn’t the ‘fun’ part of writing software. This is the nasty upkeep that goes into maintaining a building from the 1850s that’s had new rooms, plumbing, and electric wiring frankenstein-ed into it over the years.\n\n## Funding Open Source\nI first started on BentoML[^3] as a casual contributor last summer, submitting a few decently sized PRs. It was almost all intrinsically motivated; I found issues that I enjoyed working on and that I knew I would learn lots from. Satisfied with my experience, I decided to join the team as a paid contractor expecting to just continue the type of work I was doing in the summer. As issue after issue piled on, I slowly started to realize just how much extra work being a maintainer meant and why it was a paid position. Making proposals, triaging issues, adding tests, and writing documentation took up the majority of my time. While I recognized it was important work, it was not work I was intrinsically motivated to do. Thus, to motivate people like me to get that work done, an extrinsic motivator -- in this case, money -- needed to be applied.\n\nHow do we best incentivize maintainers to work tasks stripped of the very excitement and promise of creation that initially drew them to the project in the first place? There is a jarring disconnect between work that is needed versus work that is intrinsically motivated. This is where I believe open source funding should play a role. There are two main potential avenues to go about this.\n\n\n### Funding projects\nOne possibility is to fund projects directly. This route builds a brand around the project. The status of the project then transcends any single person’s contributions and becomes a tangible entity that has the brand recognition and reputation that comes with becoming an independent entity.\n\nProjects also tend to attract corporate/government funding much better than individuals can since companies are more comfortable paying for a product (code) than for a one off contract (talent). As part of the transaction, companies are typically promised service availability, influence in decision making, or technical support. However, this tradeoff also means that projects lose a bit of their freedom. Not only do maintainers have to worry about the future of the project, they need to make sure that the agreements laid out between the project and the companies are met too.\n\n### Funding individuals\nA more individualistic model would provide greater flexibility and avoids the centralized governance issues that are so antithetical to what open source stands for. Maintainers then don’t need to deal with figuring out who should get paid how much as each maintainer is responsible for securing their own funding (if even needed). Unlike a company, what each maintainer looks to get from contributing to a project may look completely different. One may be looking to build technical skill, another to gain reputation in the community. From a governance perspective, funding individual developers is also better aligned with the distributed nature of open source projects too.\n\nAs the world’s media moves towards empowering independent creators through platforms like Twitch, YouTube, and TikTok, funding individuals is becoming an increasingly viable option. The way most of these creators make money is through *patronage* rather than donations. Although often conflated with donations, patronage is an interest and commitment to following a creator’s *future* work based on their *current* reputation rather than a one-time tip for their current work.\n\nWhen you are funding an individual, you are paying for the regular delivery of well-defined value.[^1] There are three key parts to this:\n1. **Paying.** This is an ongoing commitment to the production of content, not a one-off payment for one piece of content that catches the eye.\n2. **Regular Delivery.** It isn't random discovery, rather the content is delivered directly to the user via email or application.\n3. **Well-defined value.** It is clear what the money is going towards and what value it is helping provide.\n\nFunding individuals means trusting not just in the projects they are currently working on, but also that they will continue to deliver future value too. Rather than being tied down to one project, creators then have the creative freedom to apply what they learned and create more groundbreaking initiatives.\n\n## Mixing money and open source\n\u003e **Q:** Won't financial rewards adversely affect developer's [incentives](thoughts/incentives.md) to contribute?\n\u003e \n\u003e **A:** Yes, but it depends on who you're funding.\n\n[Attention](thoughts/attention%20economy.md) is the main currency of production. Attention is what you divert when you choose to focus on prioritizing a feature request over adding support for a library that you promised to add a few months back. Attention is what limits you from doing everything at once.\n\nAttention, then, is a common pool resource. It is non-excludable (anyone can bid for their attention) and rivalrous (limited attention). But, by charging for access to maintainer’s attention, it then becomes a private good: excludable and rivalrous. The belief is that, by making attention excludable, the quality of contributions will increase as contributors and users compete for the attention of producers.\n\nThere are two main camps on funding open source projects. The first camp believes that we should pay all maintainers to keep their projects alive. The other camp believes that paying project maintainers will destroy the entire ideology that open source is based upon.\n\nI stand somewhere in between the two camps. I’m a big proponent of “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” There are a lot of competing motivations already, both intrinsic and extrinsic, that powers open source today. We shouldn’t touch the parts that are currently working. Rather, we should focus on funding places that are absent from existing motivation like software maintenance and documentation\n\n## Conclusion\nThere is an abundance of open source projects and casual contributors as it stands today. With the ever lowering barrier to entry, these will only become more abundant. Casual contributors already incur a marginal cost on maintainers, their contributions need a maintainer to review whether it’s okay to merge or not. Adding more extrinsic motivation will just exacerbate this existing problem. This is the same reason why initiatives like Hacktoberfest, which promises to give a free t-shirt to anyone who makes a few pull requests, are counterproductive to open source.\n\nWhat isn’t significantly increasing are the number of maintainers responsible for maintaining the existing projects we have today. We should be funding maintainers who already have the contextual knowledge to be able to effectively tackle issues and guide the project. Funding will be an important extrinsic motivator to make sure that the difficult work that needs to be done, gets done.\n\nThis is not, by any means, an all-encompassing post about funding in open source. If that’s what you’re looking for, then Eghbal’s book is a great starting point. What this post does do, however, is raise important points about the processes behind open source and prod at why exactly we need to fund these seemingly ‘free’ processes. In order for open source to continue on its growth trajectory, these are questions we need to put more collective effort into thinking about.\n\n[^1]: *Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software* by [Nadia Eghbal](https://nadiaeghbal.com/)\n[^2]: [GitHub's Arctic Vault](https://archiveprogram.github.com/)\n[^3]: [BentoML](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML)",

    "content": "\n*Extension of my thoughts about [play](thoughts/play.md) and discussions from our [Interact Circle](thoughts/Interact%20Circle%20W21.md) on [Hackathon Culture](posts/hackathons.md) and Play.*\n\n## Defining play\nI've spent a lot of the past few months reminiscing on the childhood days of finding funny looking patterns in the rocks in my backyard and building LEGOs without instruction manuals.\n\nI've spent so much time thinking about how to ['bring back play'](posts/hackathons.md), yet not a lot of thinking about *what play is*. The more I think about it, the more nebulous it feels to define. I know examples of it when I see it -- the building of blanket forts during sleepovers, the joy of beating Minecraft for the first time with your friends -- but to put words to it feels difficult.\n\nThe most intuitive definition is one that comes from Bill Watterson: play is anything that you do on your own volition or agency just for its own sake. It is an *intrinsically* motivated activity.\n\n![](/posts/images/play/agency.png)\n\nPlay is the act of enjoying the process, the means to the end. To have as much fun as possible along the way. Quoting [Kernel](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-1/joyful-subversion), to \"turn life into a canvas, rather than a graph with checkpoints\".\n\nYet this definition still seems inadequate. What separates work from play? Are they mutually exclusive? What about those who cannot afford time out of their day to do anything *but work*? Those who play games professionally?\n\nHere, I turn to Jenny Odell's [*How to Do Nothing*](thoughts/How%20to%20do%20Nothing.md) and Bernard Herbert Suit's [*The Grasshopper: Games, Life, and Utopia*](thoughts/The%20Grasshopper.md) to further explore this definition.\n\n## How to Do Nothing\nOdell’s book *How to Do Nothing* focuses on resisting the current attention economy. Doing ‘nothing’ within a productivity-obsessed environment can, in fact, help to restore communities, both locally and beyond.\n\n'Nothing', in this case, refers not to actually doing nothing but rather to not participating in the [attention economy](thoughts/attention%20economy.md) and hustle culture. 'Nothing' means doing nothing productive.\n\nRecently, I have been grappling with the question of whether self-care is [selfish](thoughts/selfish.md). My inner self wants to be able to do nothing: just do projects I find fun, hang out with my friends, and go outside. However, I know that *long term*, working hard at doing well at my job and in school will do me more good, career-wise.\n\n![](/posts/images/play/long-term.png)\n\nHow can I justify setting aside time to do nothing when I have so many people asking for my time and pulling me in so many directions? In the attention economy, attention is scarce. \n\nPlay allows us to create environments where saying 'no' is okay. By definition, nobody forces you to play. **Play is what allows us to create local spaces of abundance.**\n\n\u003e \"Caring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self preservation, and that is an act of political warfare.\"\n\nPlay is the catalyst that will enable the post-attention-economy society. But what do we do when we get there?\n\n## The Grasshopper\n*Of all the things you could do in utopia, why would one play [games](thoughts/games.md)?*\n\n*The Grasshopper* was a book unlike any I've ever read before. A talking grasshopper and his insect disciples convinced me, through [Socratic dialogue](https://www.thoughtco.com/socratic-dialogue-argumentation-1691972) nonetheless, that \"refusing to work and insisting upon devoting himself exclusively to play\" is a perfectly acceptable thing to embody.\n\nWhereas Odell focused on how to get to a post-work society, Suit's approach to play and games focuses on what to do *in* a post-work society. A utopia of doing absolutely nothing feels dreadfully boring. What is there left to do? To play games, obviously!\n\nWhen I say 'game', I don’t just mean chess, basketball, or a video game. I mean a more holistic one that includes climbing mountains, the pursuit of knowledge, and the creation of art itself.\n\nGames, as Suits defines it, are \"goal-directed activities in which inefficient means are intentionally chosen.\" In games, one *purposefully* ignores the more efficient method. To play a game is to do the crossword puzzle *without* looking up the answers, even though looking it up would be the most efficient way of finishing the crossword. The added rules and restrictions are what make possible the act of playing outside of the endless pursuit of efficiency.\n\n**Playing a game is the voluntary attempt to overcome self-imposed obstacles.**\n\n### A post-work society\nIn fact, I posit that play is not only necessary but the *only thing* that can exist in a post-work utopia. Let us explore this argument through a Socratic dialogue.\n\n---\n\n**Characters**\n- **G**: the player of games.\n- **S**: the disillusioned worker, a skeptic. \n\n**G**: I would rather die than work another day, toiling away to produce goods and services in an attempt to sate the infinitely hungry needs of society. \n\n**S**: You talk as though there are only two possibilities: either a life devoted exclusively to play or a life devoted exclusively to work. How will you feed yourself? Put a roof over your head?\n\n**G**: The only argument against the life I wish to lead is death. One dies if they do not work. Yet, death is also inevitable. To continue to work is to bring about the death of my character, my curiosity about the world, my will to exist. To continue to work would effectively cause my death. If I die regardless, I might as well live a life I fully enjoy, if not short. What is life for, if not to enjoy it and to seek pleasure out of things you find valuable?\n\n**S**: This seems awfully hedonistic of you. What about personal fulfillment? Don't you have responsibilities to the rest of society?  If everybody lived like you, society itself would collapse.\n\n**G**: I am not saying everyone should lead the life I claim to want. I simply claim that this life is the one that would lead me to be the most fulfilled. However, is it wrong to dream of a future where a life like mine could be the norm? To create [shared fiction](thoughts/fiction.md) we can rally around and build towards? Having dreamers who believe in and drive this vision forward are a necessary step to manifest it into reality.\n\n**S**: I guess there is no harm to dreaming a little. I'm curious what this future of yours could look like.\n\n**G**: Wonderful. Let us imagine an utopic future where all work has been automated by machines activated purely through thought, requiring no labour to maintain its running cogs or to provide its goods and services to society. This is a utopia of abundance. Anything you could wish for, you can have: food, luxury, knowledge, happiness. In this utopia, one does not need to work to sustain themselves. I argue that there is no work to be done here. In fact, the only *rational* activity is to play.\n\n**S**: Forgive my interruption, but how do you define 'play' here? Isn't it at odds with your definition of 'work'?\n\n**G**: I suppose I should clarify some terminology. Let us first define something as *instrumental* if it serves as the means to an end (*i.e.* as a way to accomplish a goal). Work then, is explicitly defined as labour which is *instrumentally* valuable.\n\nPlay, on the other hand, is defined as labour which is non-instrumental. It should be *intrinsically* valuable and self-motivated. Games, then, are the reversal of means and ends. When playing, the means that traditionally entail an end become the ends themselves.\n\nLet us take mountain climbing as an example. Say person **A** considers reaching the top as the end goal. For **A**, climbing is just a means of reaching the top. If a helicopter came by to offer them a lift to the top, they would happily take it.\n\nSay person **B** climbs mountains for the thrill of climbing itself. **B** actually doesn't really care if they reach the top each time, it is just a means for them to climb more mountains. Even if a helicopter offered **B** a ride to the top, they would happily decline and continue their trek up the side of the mountain.\n\nPerson **A** clearly considers mountain climbing *work* whereas **B** considers mountain climbing *play*.\n\n**S**: Ah, I see. This clarifies my understanding of how you define 'work' and 'play', but I still have a counterpoint. What about those who enjoy their work? The scientist, who after a great effort, has a major breakthrough on a problem they've been stumped on for ages. Far from rejoicing in the discovery, they are eagerly searching for their next challenge to be engaged once more. The carpenter who builds houses because she likes how they look and the feeling of it coming together. Can these individuals not exist in your utopia?\n\n**G**: Hmm. I would posit that both of the mentioned individuals are actually *playing games*. The resolution appears to be the fact that activities which one views as instrumentally valuable (work) can, for another, be intrinsically valuable (play). The human experience is subjective, there is no universal standard for whether society considers something work or play. An environment of play is created when one self-imposes rules to prevent them from the most efficient way of achieving their goal.\n\nTo the carpenter who enjoys building for its own sake, that otherwise instrumental activity has intrinsic value as well. The same could be true of anyone who really enjoys their work, whatever that work might be. This is the definition of game playing.\n\n**S**: This does make a lot of sense. So in this utopia that you propose, I could theoretically just do what I find intrinsically valuable -- play? And I suppose the rest of my needs would be met by the machines?\n\n**G**: Correct.\n\n**S**: I am excited to create this utopia of ours. Let us dream together then.\n\n---\n\n## A re-worked definition\nObviously, this is an exaggeration of the argument I'm hoping to make -- we clearly don't live in this caricature of a post-instrumental society. However, we *do* live in is a society that is malleable to change.\n\nLanguage is one of the only logically [decentralized](thoughts/decentralization.md) aspects of humanity. It is also one that has considerable effects on [how we think](posts/new-words.md) about ourselves and the world.\n\nWe started off this journey by asserting that our current accepted definition of play was inadequate. In its place, we offer a plurality of alternatives:\n\n- Play is an *intrinsically* motivated activity. \n- Play is labour which is non-instrumental.\n- Play is the act of enjoying the means to the end.\n- Play is what allows us to create local spaces of abundance.\n\nRe-defining play gives us power in the form of shared fiction which we can build towards and manifest into reality.\n\nHere's to building the future we can play in.",

To feel the warm of sunlight on our skin, to see the redness of sunset, to taste the crunch of a sweet apple, to love and be loved. Distilled, it is the ability to have subjective human experience.\n\nPhilosophers in particular define consciousness as *experience*. Something is conscious if there is an experience to *be like that thing*. But there is a deeper question that philosophers have been digging at for the past few millennia: why should all of this experience *feel* like anything? How do we get from the physical act of feeling things in our environment to the mental experience of *being* human?\n\nThis is the [[thoughts/mind body problem|mind-body problem]] and the fundamental question of the [[thoughts/Hard problem of consciousness|hard problem of consciousness.]] \n\nEver since the turbulent events of the early 20th century, **logical positivism** had flowered. Logical positivism is a belief that scientific knowledge is the *only* kind of factual knowledge, discounting and pushing away the realm of [[thoughts/metaphysics|metaphysics]] to the sidelines. The question of consciousness was (and in many ways, still is) taboo to many philosophers and scientists alike, perceived as too \"new-age-y\" or metaphysical to be considered a worthwhile pursuit. Philosophers were encourage to \"earn their keep\" by providing actual contributions to science rather than musing about what it means to be human.\n\nAs metaphysical questions about consciousness faded slowly, behaviourism found its footing through psychology. Behaviourists believed that the mind could be entirely understood purely by reducing it to its environmental inputs and behavioural outputs.\n\nTo give them credit, many scientists found success through this approach. Scientists figured out how to correlate brain states with solving problems and even feelings of pain and pleasure. They figured out how activations in the V1 area of the cortex react to certain colours like the redness of an apple. Further physiological work discovered the existence of the V4-V8 areas which had an even stronger correlation with shapes, motion, and lighting conditions. The moonshot goal was to build up to a full **neural correlate of consciousness** or [[thoughts/Neural Correlates of Consciousness (NCC)|NCC]] -- some way of explaining what physical brain states correlate to mental ones.\n\nYet, at the end of the day, all of this work only proved *correlation*. Behaviourist approaches were no closer to answering the question of how physical brain states *produce* mental ones. **Any theory that attempted to explain consciousness in terms of the physical is forced to take no less than a leap of faith from the objectively physical to the subjectively mental.** This leap is across what is known as the [[thoughts/Hard problem of consciousness#Explanatory Gap|explanatory gap]].\n\n\u003e \"The mind-body problem is not just a local problem having to do with the relation between mind, brain, and behaviour in living animal organisms ... it invades our understanding of the entire cosmos and its history.\" (Thomas Nagel, *Mind and Cosmos*)\n\nThis isn't just a problem for philosophy or neuroscience but rather our **entire understanding of the physical world** -- this is the blind spot of science.\n\n![[thoughts/images/explanatory-gap-midjourney.png]]*\"Vector illustration of hands grasping at the explanatory gap\" @midjourney*\n\n Scientific [[thoughts/Materialism|materialists]] argue that science and the scientific method enables us to get \"outside of experience\" and grasp the world in and of itself. Yet, subjective experience is present at every step[^1]. When we look to send people to the cosmos, we do so by formulating theories and models about how we think they work. All of this depends on the subjective experience. We look at the results of our complex telescopes and formulate theories based off of what we have learned and have observed in the world. We pull scientific models from our experiments and observations but again, these are models and idealisations, not actual instantiations of *things* in the world.\n\n\u003e \"In principle, it is absurd to think that we can explain consciousness by reducing it to certain objects of science, since these objects are abstract relational structures extracted from the life-world of lived experience\" (Husserl, *The Crisis of the European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology*)[^11]\n\nGottfried Leibniz, Immanuel Kant, Arthur Schopenhauer, and Bertrand Russel were all strong believers that a fully physical account of the world actually offers no explanation of the *intrinsic nature*[^2] of the things within it.[^6] The ideal gas law tells us how pressure, volume, amount, and temperature of a gas are all related to each other, but tells us nothing about what each of those things in and of themselves are. Chemistry tells us that Carbon has an atomic number of six. At first glance, this seems be an intrinsic property. But probe deeper at what an atomic number truly represents and all it is the number of protons it has. Protons themselves are not \"real\" things. They are a convenient model of how this group of abstractions we call quarks behaves together depending on their relations. Mass is a property that determines how an object will obey the relation $m = \\frac{F}{a}$. Again, it is abstractions all the way down. Purely physical descriptions **tell us not what matter *is* but what what it *does*.**\n\nPhysics, by name, is supposed to be a mathematical theory of the physical. Yet mathematics by nature is purely relational; numbers are quantifiers on abstract objects, formulas describe precise relations between variables. But intuitively, there must also be an *intrinsic nature* to these objects as well. *What is an atom in and of itself?* This question is not answered by a relational account of the world.\n\nIt is tempting to say at this point that perhaps a relational view all there is to reality. After all, this is realistically all that is useful to the functioning of society. It has enabled us to program silicon, photograph the depths of the universe, and predict weather across the world. \n\nYet intuitively, a world held up purely through relations does not make sense. As Hedda Hassel Mørch pointed out in her critique of physics for ignoring consciousness, \"for there to be a relation there must be two things being related.\" [^3] Otherwise, the relationship is empty -- \"a show that goes on without performers, or a castle constructed out of thin air.\" Mørch argues that all physical relations should be made real by some substance that itself is not purely relational or else there would be no difference between mere mathematical abstraction and the concrete universe.\n\nClearly, if we wish to poke beyond this veil of pure abstractions, our current explanations of our reality will not do: intrinsic natures simply cannot be captured through a purely physical approach. [[thoughts/Materialism|Materialism]] as given so far does not seem to stand. Taking its physical description as the totality is like **confusing the map with the territory.** It may be fine if you just need the map to navigate the world, but to open one's eyes to the real world, we must dig deeper.\n\nWe thus try to **bridge the explanatory gap from the other side**. Perhaps consciousness is fundamental to reality, not the other way around.\n\n![[thoughts/images/life-world-ghibli.png]]*\"The life-world contains the universe\" illustrated in the style of Studio Ghibli @midjourney*\n\nUp until this point, I have painted a picture of why the intrinsic nature of consciousness cannot be fully explained by the physical. Now, I push to make a stronger claim that consciousness is **primary** -- namely existentially, transcendentally, and epistemologically. For something to be primary is for it to be the first and foremost, a prior for all else that comes after it.\n\nIt seems almost self-evident that consciousness is **existentially primary** -- it is through the subjective human experience that the universe is disclosed to us. Arthur Eddington argued that the one thing we know concretely about consciousness is that it has an intrinsic nature.[^8] [[thoughts/Descartes' Meditations|René Descartes]] famously said \"cogito, ergo sum\": I think, therefore I am.[^9] It is the foundation upon which Descartes builds upon his certainty in his knowledge about the world. In all the ways we can be mistaken about reality, consciousness is not one of them -- it is a reality that we apprehend directly and without inference. Thus, consciousness is existentially primary.\n\nConsciousness is also **transcendentally primary**. Kant defined transcendental primacy as all knowledge which is \"occupied not so much with objects as with the mode of our knowledge of objects in so far as this mode of knowledge is to be possible a priori.\" [^10] In more colloquial language, the transcendental primacy of consciousness refers to how consciousness is not another object of knowledge, but that by which any object can become *knowable*.\n\nEdmund Husserl, in his 1936 work *The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology,* defines a concept called the *life-world*. Roughly defined, it refers to the world as it is collectively experienced. Husserl likened this model of consciousness to our visual horizon: it is not really an object, but a rather a process of uncovering or displaying potentialities.[^11]\n\nIt is in this way then that the horizonal sense of consciousness is not something that can be *had,* but rather something we *live*. Quoting Bertrand Russel, \"we know nothing about the intrinsic quality of physical events except when these are mental events that we directly experience.\"[^12] As such, consciousness is transcendentally primary.\n\n![Merleau-Ponty on the world and consciousness](thoughts/images/Merleau-Ponty%20on%20the%20world%20and%20consciousness.png)*Merleau-Ponty on the world and consciousness*\n\nConsciousness is additionally **epistemically primary** -- it is the source and destination of all knowledge. In creating models, we set aside aspects of experience on which we have doubts about (e.g. our senses, emotions, etc.) and extract idealised and abstract models (e.g. mathematics, physics, logic). Even the most abstract physical relation or mathematical formulas describe some \"real\" thing we are trying to model or express a relation between. These models ideals and models are only as useful insofar as we can implement these abstractions as things we can use to measure, predict, and control phenomena within our lived experience. In this way, consciousness is epistemically primary.\n\nI will pause here to clarify that I am *not* claiming consciousness to be ontologically primary. I am not making any sort of [[thoughts/Panpsychism|panpsychist claim]] that consciousness exists as a fundamental aspect of reality where everything has a small amount of consciousness.[^5] Neither am I claiming that consciousness exists inherently in the natural world as a fundamental aspect of reality.[^4]\n\nRather, I am positing a form of **neutral monism** that sits somewhere between physicalism and idealism. Monism, in its simplest form, suggests that there is only one *kind* of underlying reality. A neutral stance on this does not side with either matter or mind, instead a potential 3rd substance. Russel explained this form of reality as having \"a single underlying nature that is *neither* mental nor physical but capable of being expressed in these two different ways.\"[^13]  Much like the interiors and exterior of any object, Russel's account of the mental and physical imply and necessitate each other as reflection of a single nature.\n\nIn Husserl's horizon metaphor, the horizon is not possible without a world to be observed but the world also cannot be perceived without a perceiver. Similarly, the horizon of consciousness is not possible without the physical but the the physical cannot be perceived without the mental. It is absurd to try to reduce one completely to another.\n\nFrancisco Varela's notion of \"mutually generative constraints,\"[^14] points toward a possibility where both physicalism and idealism work together towards reciprocal enrichment:\n\n1.  Phenomenological reports may help to pick out and ascribe meaning to previously unnoticed neural configurations\n2.  Neurological findings may become an incentive for re-categorization and further development in phenomenological research\n\nThis neutrally monistic view of consciousness does not \"solve\" the hard problem. Rather, the problem never even arises because the physical world is no longer the standard for being, and objectivity is no longer the ultimate standard of being. \n\nIt is in this neutrally monistic view that one can acknowledge consciousness as primary without necessarily needing to discount our existing objective knowledge about the world.\n\nInstead of absorbing or reducing contents of experience into the relational network of objective science or vice versa, we could strive towards embedding these experiences within a broader network of a potentially new amplified science of structures which we may not know of yet.\n\n*Adapted version of my [[thoughts/Primary of Consciousness|PHIL451A final paper]].*\n\n![[thoughts/images/observatory-midjourney.png]]*\"A beautiful observatory in the park of Mars\" in the style of James Paik and Ross Tran @midjourney*\n\n[^1]: The upshot is that there is no simple way to remove our experience as scientists from the characterization of the physical world. In Popperian fashion, scientific knowledge then is a self-correcting narrative made from the world and our experience of it evolving together. Popper personally rejected logical positivism as well. He believe that there are statements that have varying statements of 'truth' or [[thoughts/truth#Verisimilitude|verisimilitude]] relative to our conscious experience of the world.\n[^2]: In philosophy, an intrinsic property is a property that an object has in and of itself, whereas extrinsic properties are properties than depend on that object's relation with other things.\n[^3]: *Is Matter Conscious?* in [Nautilus](https://nautil.us/is-matter-conscious-6028/)\n[^4]: The position of ontological idealism explores this further, positing it is fundamentally human consciousness that gives rise to the physical world. This is not a new idea, having being explored in both Eastern thought (through [[thoughts/idealism#Pratyabhijna Self-awareness|Pratyabhijna self-awareness]]) and Western thought (platonic idealism).\n[^5]: In fact, I think there are quite a few problems in panpsychist theories, namely [[thoughts/Consciousness is not Information|how theories like Giulio Tononi's IIT define information]] and how they fail to adequately resolve [[thoughts/emergent behaviour#Combination Problem|the Combination Problem]]. The typical [[thoughts/Panpsychism|panpsychist]] response would be to agree that consciousness could never emerge from exclusively physical processes and that consciousness exists as a fundamental aspect of reality (often referred to as the Intrinsic Nature Argument). One of the original arguments for panpsychism posited by Eddington, Russell, Strawson relies on quite a few problem assumptions (namely, that \"relational properties are determined by intrinsic properties\" and \"own inner awareness reveals that phenomenality is an intrinsic property\"). A more modern form of this argument crops up in IIT and has been widely lauded as influential in finally providing a testable hypothesis of consciousness. However, Tononi defines information in very atypical fashion and refuses to address potential edge cases in which integrated information of seeming non-conscious objects (e.g. a large number of connected logic gates which do not compute anything meaningful) is unreasonably high (and potentially infinite).\n[^6]: Kant, Immanuel, 1787, _Critique of Pure Reason_.

    "content": "\nReact is, as the [website](https://reactjs.org/) says, \"a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.\" What this means exactly, is often confusing to people.\n\nMany articles claim to teach you \"React in 10 minutes\" but rarely go beyond a few code examples. The problem is that this leaves you with an inkling of what React looks like and maybe how to write a bit of it, but no clue *why* it works and how to think about fixing React bugs.\n\nThis isn’t some random tutorial which throws you a bunch of example code that you go on to copy-and-paste and then leaves you hanging wondering what it does. The goal of the workshop is to give attendees a good foundation of the concepts within React, why people choose to use React, and how it works behind the hood. Hopefully, this gives you a good enough foundation to hit the ground running and avoid entire classes of bugs when starting out in React!\n\nThis post assumes that you know basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\n\n## What is React?\nThe TLDR; is that it's a bunch of code you can add to your project that makes building websites and interfaces that **react** to changes when you do things (e.g. press buttons) really easy.\n\nReact has two distinguishing features that set it apart:\n1. React is **declarative** meaning you tell React exactly what you want the page to look like and it'll figure out how to do that.\n2. React is **component based** meaning that you can create pieces of the UI that you can reuse across different parts of your application.\n\n## How a website works\nMost likely, you've written some code for a website in plain old HTML before. This, as you know, defines the structure for what is inside a webpage. If the webpage is a house, the HTML is the blueprint that tells you what the house should generally look like and what is inside.\n\nYet, to turn that bunch of HTML into something displayable in your web browser, it needs to parse it into a more intermediate format it can more easily work with: the Document Object Model (DOM).\n\nThe nested structure of the HTML lends itself very well to a tree-like structure which the browser can then efficiently traverse and make updates to.\n\n![Turning HTML into the DOM and then into the actual site](/posts/images/react/html-dom-site.png)*Turning HTML into the DOM and then into the actual site*\n\n## How React works\n### The Virtual DOM\nOf course, you can still manipulate and interact with the regular DOM [through JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction) still but the main gripe that React has with this way of manipulating the DOM (e.g. adding new things to the screen or modifying existing bits on the page) is that it can be *realllyyy* slow in some cases.\n\nThis is where the mystical **virtual DOM** comes in. Modifying the DOM in a declarative way is difficult because modifying the real DOM is imperative by nature, making it difficult to write declarative applications. You could use `element.innerHTML = 'your html'` in a declarative fashion, but an in-memory version implemented in JavaScript would be faster than using `innerHTML`, which is exactly exactly what React does. React creates a virtual DOM where it keeps track of what it would *like* the real DOM to look like and then intelligently batches and combines changes together to optimize and squeeze the most performance out of the few expensive writes to the real DOM that it actually does. More info on [how DOM diffing and patching works](https://buildwithreact.com/tutorial/under-the-hood) under the hood for those curious.\n\n\u003e Please note that Virtual DOM is not faster than raw, imperative operations on the real DOM (best performance). React uses the Virtual DOM because it is a relatively efficient way of declaratively representing your UI from state, and much faster compared to straight `innerHTML` calls.\n\n![React's Virtual DOM in action. ReactDOM.render() tells React to attach your React components to the real DOM](/posts/images/react/virtual-DOM.png)*React's Virtual DOM in action. ReactDOM.render() tells React to attach your React components to the real DOM*\n\n### Components\nAnother things that React tackles really well is that regular HTML and JS makes it a lot more difficult than it should be to re-use the same UI and logic across different pages on your website.\n\n![What if you wanted to reuse this 'product card' component?](/posts/images/react/component-reuse.png)*What if you wanted to reuse this 'product card' component?*\n\nThe main philosophy of functional React is that you shouldn't override and inherit behaviour. Instead, get the behaviour you want by creating and composing reusable *components*. Each of these components can hold some sort of data of its own, called its **state**. Each component can also take in a few arguments or parameters called **properties** or **props** for short. Each component is composed up of either primative HTML elements (e.g. `\u003cdiv\u003e` or `\u003ch1\u003e`) or other React components. The elements that a component is made up of are called its **children**.\n\n![React Component Diagram](/posts/images/react/component-diagram.png)*React Component Diagram*\n\nBecause React uses composition to build components, there is a natural *downward flow of information*, where components pass data to their children. Thus, to change a parent's state, the parent needs to explicitly pass a callback function that allows that behaviour to the child (e.g. an arrow function that wraps the `setState` function for the parent). This is detailed more in the 'Building an App section'.\n\n### JSX\nJSX is a extension to regular JS which lets you write HTML-like code to define React components. It is declarative at heart, meaning you describe exactly what you want the component to look like based off of some given data (props and state in this case) and React will figure out how to get the page to look like that.\n\nJSX can be just regular HTML.\n\n```jsx\n\u003cdiv\u003eBottom Text\u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\nIt can also be a user-defined component. In this case, the component has no children or 'inner HTML' so we can write its shorthand.\n\n```jsx\n\u003cExampleComponent/\u003e\n```\n\nWe can also pass in properties to a component by adding a tag with that property name. Any string can be passed in regularly, or you can also choose to pass in any JS expression (e.g. number, function, object, etc.) by enclosing it in curly braces.\n\n```jsx\n\u003cHello name=\"World\" someData={2 + 3}/\u003e\n```\n\nTo 'compose' components, you can nest them as children within each other.\n\n```jsx\n\u003cDashboard\u003e\n  \u003cGreeting/\u003e\n  \u003cStatistics\u003e\n    \u003cBarChart data={data}/\u003e\n    \u003cPieChart data={data}/\u003e\n  \u003c/Statistics\u003e\n\u003c/Dashboard\u003e\n```\n\nGreat, so that's just what JSX *looks like*, how do we use it in React? The first thing to note is that a **component in React is defined as a function which returns some JSX**.\n\nHere's a simple 'Hello World' component in React! We then write a return statement that defines exactly how to render this component (i.e. what children make up this component).\n\nNote that React passes us all of the props from the parent in a 'props' object. Then, in the return statement's JSX, we can then access the name property by using `{}` to indicate a JS expression and accessing the 'name' field in the `props` object.\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react'\n\nfunction Greeting(props) {\n  return \u003cp\u003eHello {props.name}!\u003c/p\u003e\n}\n```\n\nLet's say we want to create a `\u003cHelloWorld/\u003e` component that re-uses our `\u003cGreeting/\u003e` component from above.\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react'\n\nfunction HelloWorld() {\n  return \u003cdiv\u003e\n    \u003ch1\u003eMy Hello World App\u003c/h1\u003e\n    \u003cGreeting name=\"World!\"/\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n}\n```\n\nThen, at the end, we tell React to finally render our `\u003cHelloWorld/\u003e` component into the actual DOM by using `ReactDOM.render(...)`. Here, we choose to replace the element with the id 'root' in the real DOM with our `\u003cHelloWorld/\u003e` component.\n\n```jsx\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom'\n\nReactDOM.render(HelloWorld, document.getElementById('root'))\n```\n\n## Life Cycle\nSo far we've covered static components using just plain old JSX and data passing using props, but this misses the biggest benefit that React offers: reactivity to data changes. We'll look a little at the life cycle of React components to see where we can update a component when data changes.\n\nThere are three main parts to the life cycle to a React component. They are mounted, updated, and eventually unmounted.\n\n![React Component Lifecycle](/posts/images/react/lifecycle.png)*React Component Lifecycle*\n\n### Mount\nMounting happens when the component is first added to the virtual DOM. Here, we set the initial state of the component (e.g. to track the number of clicks, a user's input, etc.) and tell React to update the DOM.\n\n### Update\nAn update happens when its parent component is updated or when its state or props changes. Here, we can modify the state of the component, do asyncronous things (like call an API), and rerender the component.\n\n### Unmount\nThe unmount happens when the parent component is no longer rendered to the DOM. Now, we cleanup anything that needs to be cleaned up, destroying all state, and removing the component from the DOM.\n\n## Hooks\nNote that when a component updates, React will call the component again with the new props thus **clearing all local state**. This is why you can't just declare a new `const` inside a component for state. Introducing: hooks! They are JavaScript functions that allow us to 'hook' into the React lifecycle and do things like fetch data and persist state.\n\n### useState\nLet's say we want to track how many times a user has clicked a button. A naive implementation might look something like this, where we define a variable in the scope of the component.\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react'\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  let count = 0\n\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003eYou clicked {count} times\u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003cbutton onClick={() =\u003e count++}\u003e\n        Increment\n      \u003c/button\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this will not work! Because React doesn't know about the count variable, incrementing it will not update the component and thus not re-render it onto the screen. To register a component's state with React, we use the `useState` hook.\n\nThis will allow React to preserve the state between re-renders. `useState` returns a pair: a read-only variable representing the _current_ state value and a function that lets you set a new value for the state.\n\nThe first parameter to the `useState` hook is the default value that React should assign to the state when the component is first mounted.\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { useState } from 'react'\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  // Declare a new state variable called count initialized to 0\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n\n  // When the button is clicked, update the count to be\n  // the previous count + 1\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003eYou clicked {count} times\u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003cbutton onClick={() =\u003e setCount(count + 1)}\u003e\n        Increment\n      \u003c/button\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nNow when the button is clicked, the count is then incremented by one. Because we used the `useState` hook, React knows about this component state and will then known to re-render the component when the state is updated.\n\nNote that you **cannot** directly modify the `count` variable because it is read-only. If you want to mutate it, use the `setCount` function that is returned from the hook.\n\n#### A note about syntax\nBecause this is just using JavaScript's [destructuring assignment syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment), we can call the variable whatever we want.\n\n```jsx\nconst [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n\n// is equivalent to\n\nconst state = useState(0) // state is an array of length 2\nconst count = state[0]\nconst setCount = state[1]\n```\n\n### useEffect\nAsynchronous data fetching, manually changing the window title, and setting recurring events are all examples of side effects. Yet, React won't let us do that right now because we have no way to do things in between the mount and unmount lifecycle events.\n\nIntroducing the `useEffect` hook, which lets us peform side effects within components.\n\nLet's consider the previous example of keeping track of amount of times the user has clicked a button. What if we want to set the window title to be the number of times the button has been clicked so far?\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n\n  // setup a new effect that runs everytime `count` is updated\n  // this will re-render the component too\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    document.title = `${count} clicks`\n  }, [count])\n\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003eYou clicked {count} times\u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003cbutton onClick={() =\u003e setCount(count + 1)}\u003e\n        Increment\n      \u003c/button\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\n`useEffect` doesn't return anything, but takes two parameters. The first is the callback which is the effect we want to run, this callback takes 0 parameters. The second parameter is the array of dependencies for the effect. React uses this array to determine when to re-run our effect (you can optionally omit this entire array to re-run the effect *every* time the component updates).\n\n### useSWR\nWhat about making API requests to fetch user data or data from an external third-party? While technically you can do this with `useEffect` and `useState`, it gets messy really quickly.\n\nThis hook isn't an official React one, but I use it so much in my projects that it might as well be. Introducing `useSWR`, a [hook from Vercel](https://swr.vercel.app/) that lets you make asynchronous HTTP requests extremely easily.\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react'\nimport useSWR from 'swr'\n\n// a function that performs an http request and returns a response\n// this can be reused across all of your requests\nconst fetcher = url =\u003e fetch(url).then(res =\u003e res.json())\n\nfunction Profile() {\n  // example HTTP GET request to /api/user\n  const { data, error } = useSWR('/api/user', fetcher)\n\n  // we can use conditional rendering to display\n  // error or loading messages\n  if (error) return \u003cdiv\u003efailed to load\u003c/div\u003e\n  if (!data) return \u003cdiv\u003eloading...\u003c/div\u003e\n\n  // if the code reaches this point, we know\n  // that our request will have finished and have no errors!\n  return \u003cdiv\u003eHello {data.name}!\u003c/div\u003e\n}\n```\n\n### Order matters\nOne really common beginner mistake that I made a lot when first starting out is that **hooks need to be called in the exact same order every time.** This means that you can't have hooks after any conditional returns, inside `if` statements, or inside function/callback definitions.\n\n```jsx\n// DON'T: conditionally run hook\nif (someCondition) {\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    // run effect here\n  })\n}\n\n// DO: put conditional inside the hook\nuseEffect(() =\u003e {\n  if (someCondition) {\n    // run effect here\n  }\n})\n```\n\nFor more information, read the [official React docs on this](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html#only-call-hooks-at-the-top-level).\n\n## Building an App\nGreat, so now you have all this theory. You're probably itching to build something and that's exactly what this section is for! We'll be building a very basic **todo application** where you can add and remove from the list. For this bit, a basic understanding of [Git and GitHub](https://resources.nwplus.io/2-beginner/how-to-git-github.html) is required.\n\nFirst, make you install a version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) `\u003e= 12.x`. If you are unsure, you can check your Node version by doing `node -v`.\n\n```bash\n$ node -v\nv12.14.0 # good to go!\n```\n\n### Starter Code\nNormally, most people will tell you to run `create-react-app` here to create a new React application, but I find that `create-react-app` has way too much boilerplate (extra code) for my taste so I made my own more stripped down version of `create-react-app`. It contains everything you need to get started with a new React app and, in my opinion, is a lot less confusing.\n\nTo get started open your terminal of choice and clone this [minimal React template](https://github.com/jackyzha0/min-react). This will give you all the code you need to get started!\n\n```bash\n# clone the repository\n$ git clone https://github.com/jackyzha0/min-react.git\n\n# navigate to folder\n$ cd min-react\n\n# install dependencies\n$ npm i\n\n# run local dev server! (open localhost:3000 in your browser)\n$ npm run start\n```\n\nThen, let's remove some of the starter files we don't need. Delete the `src/components` folder. We'll be working `src/App.js` for the rest of this tutorial.\n\n### Creating the App component\nLet's delete what's in `src/App.js` and start fresh. What do we need in our todo app? Well, we need to track the list of todos the user has. Let's create a state for that and initialize it with a few default todos. Then, the component should just be a container for all of our todo items. We can just map over the `todos` state and turn them into `\u003cTodoItem\u003e` components!\n\nWe can keep the styling from the template just so it looks a bit nicer.\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { useState } from 'react'\nimport styled from 'styled-components'\n\n// custom styling using styled-components!\nconst AppContainer = styled.div`\n margin: 40vh 30vw;\n`\n\nfunction App() {\n  // setup todos\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([\"do laundry\", \"finish homework\"])\n\n  // app is composed up of all the current todos\n  return (\n    \u003cAppContainer\u003e\n      \u003ch1\u003etodos\u003c/h1\u003e\n      {todos.map((item, i) =\u003e \u003cTodoItem\n        key={i}\n        name={item}\n      /\u003e)}\n    \u003c/AppContainer\u003e\n  )\n}\n\nexport default App\n```\n\nThe problem is, we don't have a `\u003cTodoItem\u003e` component yet. Let's make it!\n\n### Creating a Todo component (Component Styling)\nWe need a component to display each of our todo items. The only prop we really need is the name of the todo to display it so we'll make a simple component; no need to track state or anything.\n\n```jsx\nfunction TodoItem(props) {\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003e{props.name}\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nLet's add a hover state so that the item has a strikethrough effect when you hover over it. We can do this using `styled-components` which is a way for us to add CSS to our components really easily.\n\n```jsx\n// create a 'styled' div that has a strikethrough on hover\nconst TodoItemContainer = styled.div`\n  \u0026:hover \u003e p {\n    text-decoration: line-through;\n  }\n`\n\nfunction TodoItem(props) {\n  // replace the original div with the `TodoItemContainer`\n  // styled div we just created\n  return (\n    \u003cTodoItemContainer\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003e{props.name}\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003c/TodoItemContainer\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nGreat! Now let's see what that looks like.\n\n![Our todo app with a strikethrough effect!](/posts/images/react/todo-0.png)*Our todo app with a strikethrough effect!*\n\n### Deleting a Todo (Passing callbacks)\nHmm, would be great if we could actually delete a todo by just clicking on a todo item. Good thing [React has event handlers](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html) just like regular HTML elements do! Let's modify our `\u003cTodoItem\u003e` to handle a click event. To do that, we just pass a callback to the the desired component using the `onClick` prop.\n\n```jsx\nfunction TodoItem(props) {\n  return (\n    \u003cTodoItemContainer\n      onClick={() =\u003e {\n        alert(`You finished ${props.name}!`)\n      }}\n    \u003e\n      \u003cp\u003e{props.name}\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003c/TodoItemContainer\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nNow, when we click each todo item, our page will give us an alert saying we completed that item! Not super useful though. Can we just delete the item from the component?\n\nRecall from earlier that with React, information flows *downward* in the component hierarchy tree. This means that in order to modify the state of the parent (`\u003cApp\u003e` in this case), we need to pass a callback that helps us modify the information.\n\nTo do that, we create a `deleteTodo` function in `\u003cApp\u003e` and then pass an anonymous function to each todo which deletes that given todo. Note that because we can't directly modify the `todos` variable as it is read-only, we create a copy of it using the spread syntax (`[...todos]`), then remove a single element by index using splice.\n\n```jsx\nfunction App() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([\"do laundry\", \"finish homework\"])\n\n  // callback to remove a todo\n  const deleteTodo = (index) =\u003e {\n    // copy current todos\n    const newTodos = [...todos]\n    // remove todo at given index\n    newTodos.splice(index, 1)\n    setTodos(newTodos)\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \u003cAppContainer\u003e\n      \u003ch1\u003etodos\u003c/h1\u003e\n      {todos.map((item, i) =\u003e \u003cTodoItem\n        key={i}\n        name={item}\n        deleteCallback={() =\u003e deleteTodo(i)}\n      /\u003e)}\n    \u003c/AppContainer\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThen, we update `\u003cTodoItem\u003e` to use this callback on click.\n\n```jsx\nfunction TodoItem(props) {\n  return (\n    \u003cTodoItemContainer onClick={props.deleteCallback}\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003e{props.name}\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003c/TodoItemContainer\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nGreat, so now we have display and deletion. Adding new todos is up next!\n\n### Adding a Todo (Form Inputs)\nFirst, let's create a short form component that will allow us to accept user input. Let's setup a state field for the user input and create a form with a single text input. To update the state of the component as the user types, we attach an `onChange` event handler to the `\u003cinput\u003e` which sets the value of the `todo` state to whatever the input field is.\n\n```jsx\nfunction TodoForm(props) {\n  // form state\n  const [todo, setTodo] = useState(\"\")\n\n  return (\n    \u003cform\u003e\n      \u003cinput\n        type=\"text\"\n        value={todo}\n        onChange={e =\u003e setTodo(e.target.value)}\n      /\u003e\n    \u003c/form\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nNow, let's handle what happens when the user submits this form (i.e. presses enter). We add an `onSubmit` handler to the form to handle this. Note that we specifically tell the browser to *not* refresh the page (which is the default behaviour for a form submission) and clear the form state.\n\nBy telling React that the value of the `\u003cinput\u003e` is equal to the component state `todo`, React knows that this is a [controlled component](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components), meaning that the component state is the **single source of truth** here.\n\n```jsx\nfunction TodoForm(props) {\n  const [todo, setTodo] = useState(\"\")\n\n  const handleSubmit = (e) =\u003e {\n    // prevent form from refreshing page\n    e.preventDefault()\n\n    // show an alert with user input\n    alert(todo)\n\n    // clear form\n    setTodo(\"\")\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \u003cform onSubmit={handleSubmit}\u003e\n      \u003cinput\n        type=\"text\"\n        value={todo}\n        onChange={e =\u003e setTodo(e.target.value)}\n      /\u003e\n    \u003c/form\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nLet's add a bit of styling to make the text box not as ugly and add `\u003cTodoForm\u003e` to the end of the todos list so it actually gets rendered.\n\n```jsx\nconst TodoInput = styled.input`\n padding: 0.7em 0.5em;\n border: 1px solid black;\n border-radius: 4px;\n`\n\nfunction TodoForm(props) {\n  const [todo, setTodo] = useState(\"\")\n\n  const handleSubmit = (e) =\u003e {\n    // prevent form from refreshing page\n    e.preventDefault()\n\n    // show an alert with user input\n    alert(todo)\n\n    // clear form\n    setTodo(\"\")\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \u003cform onSubmit={handleSubmit}\u003e\n      \u003cTodoInput\n        type=\"text\"\n        placeholder=\"Add a new todo...\"\n        value={todo}\n        onChange={e =\u003e setTodo(e.target.value)}\n      /\u003e\n    \u003c/form\u003e\n  )\n}\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([\"do laundry\", \"finish homework\"])\n\n  const deleteTodo = (index) =\u003e {\n    const newTodos = [...todos]\n    newTodos.splice(index, 1)\n    setTodos(newTodos)\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \u003cAppContainer\u003e\n      \u003ch1\u003etodos\u003c/h1\u003e\n      {todos.map((item, i) =\u003e \u003cTodoItem\n        key={i}\n        name={item}\n        deleteCallback={() =\u003e deleteTodo(i)}\n      /\u003e)}\n      \u003cTodoForm/\u003e\n    \u003c/AppContainer\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nLooking snazzy!\n\n![A nice new 'Add Todo' field!](/posts/images/react/todo-1.png)*A nice new 'Add Todo' field!*\n\nFinally, let's link this up back to the main `\u003cApp\u003e` state so that adding a new todo actually modifies the state of the app. We create a `addTodo` callback and pass this to the `\u003cTodoForm\u003e` component through using a `addCallback` prop.\n\n```jsx\nfunction TodoForm(props) {\n  const [todo, setTodo] = useState(\"\")\n\n  const handleSubmit = (e) =\u003e {\n    e.preventDefault()\n    // use the provided 'addCallback' prop\n    props.addCallback(todo)\n    setTodo(\"\")\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \u003cform onSubmit={handleSubmit}\u003e\n      \u003cTodoInput\n        type=\"text\"\n        placeholder=\"Add a new todo...\"\n        value={todo}\n        onChange={e =\u003e setTodo(e.target.value)}\n      /\u003e\n    \u003c/form\u003e\n  )\n}\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([\"do laundry\", \"finish homework\"])\n\n  const deleteTodo = (index) =\u003e {\n    const newTodos = [...todos]\n    newTodos.splice(index, 1)\n    setTodos(newTodos)\n  }\n\n  // callback to add a new todo\n  const addTodo = (todo) =\u003e {\n    const newTodos = [...todos, todo]\n    setTodos(newTodos)\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \u003cAppContainer\u003e\n      \u003ch1\u003etodos\u003c/h1\u003e\n      {todos.map((item, i) =\u003e \u003cTodoItem\n        key={i}\n        name={item}\n        deleteCallback={() =\u003e deleteTodo(i)}\n      /\u003e)}\n      \u003cTodoForm addCallback={addTodo} /\u003e\n    \u003c/AppContainer\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Finished App\nAnd with that, you've finished your first React application!

React Hooks\n5. and much more!\n\nHopefully this leaves you in a really good position to becoming more comfortable with React.

Part 1 will touch on defining the problem we’re trying to solve, the data we have, and how we pre-processed it. Part 2 will focus on the architecture of the model we built, how well it does, and thoughts on improving it for the future.\n\n## The problem\n\nClassifying intents is at the core of reflect. When a user inputs an intent, its reflect’s job to figure out whether that intent should let them into the website.\n\n\u003e How do we make sure “do some marketing work for reflect” is classified as productive but “watch cute dog videos” isn’t?\n\n## Why it’s so difficult\n\nA lot of it comes down to the fact that natural language processing ([[thoughts/NLP|NLP]]) is a very difficult task. What does the sentence “learn about physics” mean, and how is it semantically different from “asdflkj I can’t do work”?\n\nWe can’t just parse for keywords and just allow a user in if we see the word “work” because that word can mean different things in different contexts. For example, “I’m not doing any work right now” would have otherwise been classified as valid. Thus, we can employ the help of a machine learning algorithm to help us capture this deeper meaning.\n\nSpecifically, the form of machine learning we will be using is called **supervised learning,** in which we give an algorithm a bunch of labelled data, tell it what it’s doing wrong, and let it ‘learn.’ Through doing this, hopefully the algorithm will be able to generalize and make predictions on unseen data too.\n\n## The data\n\nOf course, if we want to perform supervised learning, we’re going to need a lot of data. Where are we going to get all of it? Luckily, we were able to get it through 3 different sources.\n\n### Survey data (444 entries)\n\nOur team sent out an interest survey in early January in which we asked 3 questions:\n\n1. How would you answer if you were trying to visit a distracting site while trying to focus? (eg. youtube, facebook, etc)\n\n1. How would you answer if you were trying to visit a distracting site to take a quick break from your work? (eg. youtube, facebook, etc)\n\n1. How would you answer if you were trying to visit a distracting site like Facebook but to do work? (e.g. make a marketing post)\n\nWe used these answers to form the basis of our very first dataset. We ended up getting a surprising amount of entries, ending with 148 responses to 3 questions and totalling 444 different observations. Here’s what some of that data looks like after tidying it up:\n\n\u003e We classified any answer to Q1 as invalid and Q2 + Q3 as valid\n\n\n| intent | valid |\n|-|-|\n| I am watching a 5 minute video to take my mind off not being productive :/ | no |\n| I'm just bored | no |\n| I’m bored/tired and trying to relax | no |\n| ... | ... |\n| work is pretty boring, i need to take a quick break I just can't focus atm | yes |\n| I finished all my work for today so I'm going to take a break now! | yes |\n| getting some advertising done for my club | yes |\n| I need to make a post on Twitter for my job announcing the latest update to our site | yes |\n| I'm trying to network | yes |\n| ... | ... |\n\n\n### Closed Beta (790 entries)\n\nAfter we made a basic dataset, we were able to make our first (admittedly not great) model. But in doing so, this let us create an MVP to which we could use to actually test with. We then deployed this model for use to our closed beta testers and collected their responses (with consent of course!) along with the website it was input on. This was then converted into a .csv file. A few examples are show below:\n\n| intent | url |\n|-|-|\n| to do some marketing | facebook.com/ |\n| i cannot focus on my work | instagram.com/ |\n| fuel my crippling social media addiction | facebook.com/ |\n| ... | ... |\n\nThese were then hand-labelled by our reflect team in a similar format as the survey data we collected earlier.\n\n| intent | valid |\n|-|-|\n| to do some marketing | yes |\n| i cannot focus on my work | no |\n| fuel my crippling social media addiction | no |\n| ... | ... |\n\n### Closed Beta Corrections (37 entries)\n\nFinally, we created a Google Forms through which we directly asked beta testers if a decision made by reflect’s intent classifier was faulty. Specifically, we asked what they input, and what they expected. Here are a few examples:\n\n\n| input | valid |\n|-|-|\n| reply to a friend about a lab | yes |\n| listening to a youtube music playlist | yes |\n| goof off as much as possible | yes |\n|...|...|\n\n\nThis entire section of the dataset was only 37 observations, but it drastically helped us reduce false positives and false negatives by focusing specifically on misclassifications.\n\nAfter aggregating and combing all our data into one common format, we ended up with a grand total of 1271 observations. They looked something like this:\n\n\n| input | expected |\n|-|-|\n| fail school by watching youtube | no |\n| sdlkjasd | no |\n| making a quick product post (should take \u003c10 min) | yes |\n| ... | ... |\n\n\n### So?\n\nNow that we have the data, can we just throw it into a machine learning model? Unfortunately, the answer is no, not quite yet.\n\n## Data augmentation\n\nOur dataset is still pretty small, even after aggregating all of our data. It most definitely doesn’t cover all of our bases for all the possible things that future users could possibly input. So, how can we “upsample” our data to get more of it? Well, it turns out that the field of Natural Language Processing has quite a few tricks to augment our data.\n\n### Sentence Variation\n\nEssentially what sentence variation is, is just replacing a few words of given sentences with their synonyms. If we have a sentence like “I’m trying to make a marketing post,” we can swap out singular words with their synonyms and tell our network that it means the same thing.\n\nIn this example, we could get something like “I’m attempting to fabricate a marketing post”. Adding these additional sentence variations will allow our machine learning model to learn semantic relationships between similar words (e.g. fabricate and make have similar meaning)\n\n### Sentence Negation\n\nAdditionally, if we add a ‘not’ in the sentence, it should flip the meaning of the sentence. An example would be “learning about physics” is valid, whereas “not learning about physics” is not. However, if the sentence already contains ‘not’ (e.g. “I’m not being productive”), adding another ‘not’ would make the sentence too complex and obfuscated, so we just label it as invalid. In essence, we just add ‘not’ to a bunch of sentences and label them as invalid. This helps us to combat intents which use negations in a sort of round-a-bout way to confuse the algorithm.\n\n### Shuffled Sentences\n\nIf we take an existing, valid sentence and completely shuffle the words, the resulting sentence should be invalid. An example would be “to watch a crash course video*” should be valid whereas “video course a watch crash to*” should be invalid. Basically, we’re just shuffling existing sentences and also labelling them as invalid. This helps us to combat intents which grammatically make no sense, but are otherwise valid.\n\n### Garbage Sentences\n\nWe can also take completely random words from the English language and put them together. The resulting sentences should all be invalid. For example, “*untinkered phalangitis shaly quinovic dish spadiciflorous unshaved” *clearly makes no sense. However, the addition of these gibberish sentences allows our model to be more robust against foreign words and out-of-vocabulary terms.\n\n### Vocabulary-mix Sentences\n\nLast but definitely not least, we can take the most common words in our dataset and mash them together. This should yield us a bunch of sentences which contain “key words” but should be marked as invalid because the context in which they are used makes no sense. For example, “video look watching” and “get research facebook take need want need message watch” are both clearly gibberish sentences, but they have a lot of keywords that one would think would let you in (e.g. video, research, watching, etc.). This lets us be more robust against those who try to get around the algorithm using keywords.\n\n## Data preprocessing\n\nWhat about now? Can we throw it into the neural network yet? Well, no. We may have increased the amount of data we have to work with, but we also need to convert it to a form that is easy to understand for both the computer and for our algorithm. We do that with a series of functions that we apply on our data.\n\n### Strip punctuation\n\nAs the name suggests, we remove all punctuation from the input phrase. We found that including the punctuation hurt our performance, most likely due to the fact that they offer very little in terms of semantic meaning and obfuscate the real meaning of the sentence.\n\n```python\nstripPunctuation(\"I don't know if I'm being productive! :(\") \n\u003e \"I dont know if Im being productive\"\n```\n\n### Make everything lowercase\n\nAdditionally, we found that in this particular setting, capital letters also didn’t matter that much. Because of the nature we collect our data (just a simple textbox), users tend to not bother with capitalization. As such, we remove it to make it consistent across our data.\n\n```python\nlower(\"I dont know if Im being productive\")\n\u003e \"i dont know if im being productive\"\n```\n\n### Expand contractions\n\nThe English language does this weird thing where we can just smush two words together (e.g. “I am” to “I’m”). Unfortunately for us, these produce extra complexity in our model that we could reduce by making them all consistent. In our case, we chose to expand all of these contractions.\n\n```python\nexpandContractions(\"i dont know if im being productive\") \n\u003e \"i do not know if i am being productive\"\n```\n\n### Remove stop words\n\nThe English language also has a bunch of these things called **stop words** — words that do not contribute anything major to the sentence in terms of semantic understanding (usually in the context of natural language tasks such as this). A few examples of them are ‘I’, ‘me’, ‘my’, ‘by’, and ‘on’. By removing them, we once again remove unneeded complexity from the model.\n\n```python\nrmStopwords(\"i do not know if i am being productive\") \n\u003e \"not know productive\"\n```\n\n### Tokenization\n\nHowever, these words are not super friendly for machine learning algorithms who would much rather deal with integers and floating point numbers than words and sentences. How do we fix this?\n\nWell, one thing we can do is turn words in indices by how often they appear, capped at the most common 1000 words — in essence, creating a vocabulary list mapping common words to numbers. For example, if “the” is the most common word, we convert it to 1. If “work” is the 8th most common word, we convert it to 8. For anything that isn’t in the top 1000, we give it the value of 0.\n\n```python\ntokenize(\"not know productive\") \n\u003e [12, 35, 7]\n```\n\n### Fixed sequence length\n\nFinally, we need to ensure that all the inputs are the same length of simplicity sake. If we were to handle dynamic length inputs, it would introduce a whole other level of complexity that we’re really not ready to deal with. As such, we can make sure all the inputs are the same length by adding a bunch of zeros to those who are too short (zero padding) or by slicing those who are too long.\n\n```python\npad([12, 35, 7], 10) \n\u003e [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 12, 35, 7]\n```\n\n### Finally\n\nAfter all of these functions have been applied, we have successfully converted a complex sentence into a series of ‘tokens’ that is easy to understand for the machine learning algorithm.\n\n```python\npreprocess(\"I don’t know if I’m being productive! :(\")\n\u003e [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 12, 35, 7]\n```\n\n## What’s next?\n\nNow that we have something ready to feed into our neural network, let’s dive into how the actual model itself works! How do we tell that this is a “valid” intent?\n\n## The model\n\nThe type of neural network that we’ll be using is called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).\n\n![credit: Christopher Olah, 2015](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4000/0*HyoZq6fOfsnn2YOC)*credit: Christopher Olah, 2015*\n\nWhat’s so special about these networks is that they are really good at modelling time-series data, making it an ideal candidate for tasks like forecasting or natural language processing.\n\n```python\n# Function to create a RNN model with given parameters\n# max_seq_len: maximum token sequence length\n# vocab_size:  size of tokenizer vocabulary\ndef RNN(max_seq_len, vocab_size):\n    inputs = Input(name='inputs', shape=[max_seq_len])\n    layer = Embedding(vocab_size, 64, input_length=max_seq_len)(inputs)\n    layer = LSTM(64, return_sequences = True)(layer)\n    layer = Dropout(0.5)(layer)\n    layer = LSTM(64)(layer)\n    layer = Dense(256, name='FC1')(layer)\n    layer = Dropout(0.5)(layer)\n    layer = Dense(1, name='out_layer')(layer)\n    layer = Activation('sigmoid')(layer)\n    model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=layer)\n    return model\n```\n\nHere’s how we define it in our [Keras code](https://github.com/jackyzha0/reflect-nlp/blob/master/nlp/net.py), don’t worry if you don’t understand it just yet! We’ll explain it in the next few paragraphs.\n\n```python\ninputs = Input(name='inputs', shape=[max_seq_len])\n```\n\nRight off the bat, you’ll notice that the first layer is the Input layer. Basically, this tells Keras to instantiate a new tensor (a multi-dimensional vector) with a given shape. In this case, we’re creating a one-dimensional tensor that is max_seq_len units long. When we trained our model, this was set to 75.\n\n```python\nlayer = Embedding(vocab_size, 64, input_length=max_seq_len)(inputs)\n```\n\nNext up, we have the Embedding layer. We could get into a really technical discussion about what this really does, but you can think of it as a layer that helps the neural network to learn semantic relationships between inputs.\n\n![credit: Rutger Ruizendaal, 2017](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3010/0*YOZ_CfmtgpUbJ9BD)*credit: Rutger Ruizendaal, 2017*\n\nEssentially, it embeds tokens in a higher dimension vector space, where distance between tokens represents its similarity.\n\n```python\nlayer = LSTM(64, return_sequences = True)(layer)\n```\n\nNow, we get into the meat of the neural network: the LSTM layer. As stated before, these LSTM networks are really good at modelling time series data like language. In this case, our LSTM network has 64 hidden units per cell, and that we’d like to pass these hidden states to the next layer. If you’d like to learn more about the inner workings of the LSTM model, theres a really good resource [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/illustrated-guide-to-lstms-and-gru-s-a-step-by-step-explanation-44e9eb85bf21)!\n\n```python\nlayer = Dropout(0.5)(layer)\n```\n\nNext, you’ll notice there are a few Dropout layers. These layers help to prevent overfitting by randomly killing off connections between the two layers (a sort of regularization). This makes sure neurons aren’t just “memorizing” the input data. This is especially important because our dataset is relatively small (~2000 observations even after augmentation), so making sure that our machine learning model can generalize outside of this limited dataset is really important.\n\n```python\nlayer = LSTM(64)(layer)\n```\n\nWe have yet another LSTM layer! By having these two chained right after each other, the first layer can pass all the values of all of its hidden states to the second layer, effectively allowing a sort of ‘deeper’ neural network.\n\n![credit: Jianjing Zhang 2018](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*0BRdnA5sJBYbaeR9)*credit: Jianjing Zhang 2018*\n\nThis deep LSTM allows our network to learn more abstract concepts, making them well suited for natural language tasks.\n\n```python\nlayer = Dense(256, name='FC1')(layer)\n```\n\nNext, we have something called a Fully Connected layer, or a Dense layer. In a dense layer, each of the input neurons is connected to every output neuron. This kind of ‘glue’ layer helps the network to pick out and discriminate feature output by our previous LSTM layer.\n\n```python\nlayer = Dense(1, name='out_layer')(layer)\nlayer = Activation('sigmoid')(layer)\n```\n\nSimilarly, we have one final Dense layer that ‘compresses’ all of the hidden units down to one neuron. However, we want the output value of this neuron to be how confident from a scale of 0 to 1 it is that the intent is valid. We do this by applying something called an activation function.\n\n![A sigmoid activation function](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*kdowh3GOGOUvGBr0)\n\nIn this case, the particular function we chose is the sigmoid activation function, which looks something like the above.\n\n### Model Overview\n\nPhew, finally got through everything! After putting it all together, we end up with a network that looks something like this:\n\n```python\n# 75 max_seq_len\n# 1000 tokenizer_vocab_size\nmodel = net.RNN(75, 1000) \nmodel.summary()\n\n# _________________________________________________________________\n# Layer (type)                 Output Shape              Param #   \n# =================================================================\n# inputs (InputLayer)          (None, 75)                0         \n# _________________________________________________________________\n# embedding_1 (Embedding)      (None, 75, 64)            64000     \n# _________________________________________________________________\n# lstm_1 (LSTM)                (None, 75, 64)            33024     \n# _________________________________________________________________\n# dropout_1 (Dropout)          (None, 75, 64)            0         \n# _________________________________________________________________\n# lstm_2 (LSTM)                (None, 64)                33024     \n# _________________________________________________________________\n# FC1 (Dense)                  (None, 256)               16640     \n# _________________________________________________________________\n# dropout_2 (Dropout)          (None, 256)               0         \n# _________________________________________________________________\n# out_layer (Dense)            (None, 1)                 257       \n# _________________________________________________________________\n# activation_1 (Activation)    (None, 1)                 0         \n# =================================================================\n# Total params: 146,945\n# Trainable params: 146,945\n# Non-trainable params: 0\n# _________________________________________________________________\n```\n\nTheres a grand total of 150,000 different trainable knobs and parameters in our neural network!\n\n## Training pipeline\n\nSo, how does the data we got earlier play a role in helping our machine learning model learn and improve?\n\nThe first component is the **loss function.** This component tells the neural network how ‘correct’ its prediction was. In this model, we will use something called [binary cross entropy](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-binary-cross-entropy-log-loss-a-visual-explanation-a3ac6025181a), which is basically a fancy word for log-based error. If the true label is 1, we can then show what the log-loss would be for some given prediction probability.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*8rd4ho_3Y6zrtra-.png)\n\nNext, we need to pick an **optimizer**. This component tells the neural network how to change its parameters to improve or ‘optimize’ itself. In this model, we chose to use an optimizer called [RMSProp](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-rmsprop-faster-neural-network-learning-62e116fcf29a) with a learning rate of 1e-3 . We aren’t going to cover all the technical details of this optimizer in this blog post, but just know that it is a very fast and effective optimizer.\n\n![RMSProp(black) vs a bunch of other optimizers. credit: Vitaly Bushaev](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*HZM5XJ-quu276w39.gif)*RMSProp(black) vs a bunch of other optimizers. credit: Vitaly Bushaev*\n\nOne important hyperparameter we choose is the **train-test split.** In data science and machine learning, we typically withhold part of our data and set it aside as a **test set**. The rest of the data will be considered the **training set.** When training the model, we never feed it the test set. As a result, we can use the test set as a metric to see how well it would perform on real-world, unseen data. In our training, we used a train-test split of 20%.\n\nAnother important hyperparameter that we can choose is the **mini-batch size**. The mini-batch size determines how many training examples we feed the machine learning model before updating its parameters. A smaller mini-batch means that we get more frequent updates to the parameters, but it also runs the risk of having outliers that may cause a bad gradient update. A large mini-batch means that we get a more accurate gradient update but it also takes longer. A similar concept is *sample size* in statistics. We could pick a larger sample to get a better estimate of the overall population, but it is often more expensive to do so. A smaller sample might contain outliers and thus be less robust of an estimate of the overall population, but it very easy to do. So, there’s this tradeoff between accuracy and speed. We found that a good balance between these was a mini-batch size of 128.\n\nWe then trained our neural network over 10 epochs. A single epoch is one iteration over the entire dataset. If we train it for too many epochs, you run the risk of overfitting (memorizing the training data), but we don’t train it enough, we run the risk of not discovering a better model. One thing we can do it minimize this problem is through the use of cross-validation, which is a technique that lets us ‘test’ on portions of the training set. Essentially, at each iteration during training, we withhold a portion of the training set and use it as a sort of ‘validation’.\n\n![credit: Raheel Shaikh](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*6XoMgZUd3SxXgqBj.png)*credit: Raheel Shaikh*\n\nBy seeing when this validation accuracy goes down, we can get a pretty good idea of when our model begins to overfit on our data, and stop the training before this happens. In training our model, we will use 5-fold [cross-validation](https://towardsdatascience.com/cross-validation-explained-evaluating-estimator-performance-e51e5430ff85).\n\nAfter all of this, we end with a training accuracy of 93.60% and test accuracy of 85.95%. Not bad at all!\n\n## Serving the model\n\nGreat! So now we have a trained model. Can we put that in the Chrome extension now? Not quite yet…\n\nOur model was written and trained with Keras (a Python Deep Learning library). Our Chrome extension is written in TypeScript. How do we get these two to work together?\n\nLuckily for us, Tensorflow.js exists! This library allows us to run Tensorflow models from within JavaScript. Tensorflow has released a script that lets us to convert a Keras model into something that Tensorflow.js understands, so we can run that to convert our models.\n\nHowever, we can’t just directly plug-and-play. You may remember that we did all of that data preprocessing before we trained our model. Tensorflow.js doesn’t have any of this built in, so we made our own implementation of it. You can check it out [here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/reflect-chrome/blob/master/src/nn.ts).\n\nWe’ll leave all the technical code out (if you’re interested, feel free to peek around the source code!), but we’ve abstracted it enough that classifying an intent is a breeze.\n\n```typescript\n// declared somewhere earlier\nconst model: nn.IntentClassifier = new nn.IntentClassifier(\"acc85.95\"); // name of converted model\n\n// send to nlp model for prediction\nconst valid: boolean = await model.predict(intent);\nif (valid) {\n    // let through\n} else {\n    // block page\n}\n```\n\n## Future improvement\n\n### Possible models\n\nWe have thought about using something more established and complex like [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) and retraining it on our dataset, however then comes the problem of runtime and memory usage.\n\nBERT is a huge model. If you thought 150 thousand parameters was a lot, wait till you see BERT’s 110 *million* parameters. This bad boy takes a few hundred times longer and many times more memory than our current model. While yes BERT may perform really well, we just don’t think it has a place inside of a Chrome extension.\n\nOur model is decently robust as it is, especially considering the entire model is \u003c2MB and takes less than 200ms to run in browser. For now, we will stick with lightweight models, but we may switch if we find a better match in the future :)\n\n### Misclassifications\n\nOf course, this algorithm isn’t perfect. It does have a lot of flaws and weaknesses that we find every day, and we’re working to fix those! If there are any misclassifications that you find in the algorithm, we love to hear about it on our feedback form: [https://forms.gle/ctypb6FmDT9RQqjv6](https://forms.gle/ctypb6FmDT9RQqjv6).\n\n## Closing\n\nThis NLP model is at the core of reflect. It is this model’s goal to predict whether user intents are valid or not. As a result, we need to make sure this algorithm is accurate, fast, and lightweight. Hopefully, through this blog post, you’ve learned a little about how we went about building a model to fulfill those requirements.\n\nLearn more about us on our website! ✨ [http://getreflect.app/](http://getreflect.app/)\n\nIf you have any further questions about reflect or this NLP model, feel free to shoot us an email at hello@getreflect.app",

Main summary and introduction on the [Substack here](https://reboothq.substack.com/p/mattern).\n\n## Article Notes\n[Source: A City is not a Computer](https://placesjournal.org/article/a-city-is-not-a-computer/)\n\n### Sidewalk Labs\nDoctoroff, the founder of Sidewalk Labs: \"What would a city look like if you started from scratch in the internet era — if you built a city 'from the [internet](thoughts/Internet.md) up?'\"\n\nSidewalk aims to be the 'fourth revolution' of urban infrastructure where the first 3 were\n1. The Steam Engine\n2. Electricity Grid\n3. Automobile\n\nConstant theme of Doctoroff is that of constant [move fast and break things](thoughts/move%20fast%20and%20break%20things.md) of innovation.\n\n### 'New Cities'\nIs it possible to build 'smart cities' tabula rasa?\n\nA sort of [Collingridge dilemma](thoughts/Collingridge%20dilemma.md) where they are constantly developing and \"versioning\" much like a software product in an agile process.\n\n### Cities as information centres\nNot only for transmitting information within a generation (breadth-wise) but also between generations (depth-wise): [generational learning](thoughts/generational%20learning.md) and [Theory of Niche Construction](thoughts/Theory%20of%20Niche%20Construction.md)!\n\n\u003e \"By means of its storage facilities (buildings, vaults, archives, monuments, tablets, books), the city became capable of transmitting a complex culture from generation to generation, for it marshaled together not only the physical means but the human agents needed to pass on and enlarge this heritage.\"\n\n\"What are the non-textual, un-recordable forms of cultural memory? These questions are especially relevant for marginalized populations, indigenous cultures, and developing nations.\" Especially related to [quantization](thoughts/quantization.md), how does always labeling and quantizing our data affect these forms of information? These forms cannot be reduced to 'information' nor can they be 'processed' easily within our digital systems. \"Yet they are vital urban intelligences that live within bodies, minds, and communities.\"\n\n### Computational Metaphors\n\nDoes this only appeal to us because of the recent obsession of [computation](thoughts/computability.md) as a metaphor?\n\nHistorically, we've analogized the brain (and the city) to technologies of our time. For example, we've compared the brain to \"lumps of clay infused with spirits, as hydraulic or electro-chemical systems, as automata.\"\n\n\u003e The _brain as computer_ is just the latest link in a long chain of metaphors that powerfully shape scientific endeavor in their own images.\n\n## Event Notes\n- So much of how we interact with cities is through a computer; how can we reclaim cities for the people within them as people instead of just as data?

More generally, they are both names for structures of sets.\n\n\u003e For the human mind, the tree is the easiest vehicle for complex thoughts. But the city is not, cannot and must not be a tree. The city is a receptacle for life. If the receptacle severs the overlap of the strands of life within it, because it is a tree, it will be like a bowl full of razor blades on edge, ready to cut up whatever is entrusted to it. In such a receptacle life will be cut to pieces. If we make cities which are trees, they will cut our life within to pieces.\n\n## [Urban planning](thoughts/urban%20planning.md)\nColumbia, Maryland → Neighbourhoods, in clusters of five, form 'villages'. Transportation joins the villages into a new town. The organization is a tree.\n\nHilberseimer's book The Nature of Cities → He describes the fact that certain Roman towns had their origin as military camps. The symbol is apt, for, of course, the organization of the army was designed precisely in order to create discipline and rigidity.\n\n## Abolish hierarchies\nWhenever we have a tree structure, it means that within this structure no piece of any unit is ever connected to other units, except through the its parent (meaning the unit as a whole)\n\nDoes power always need to function top down?\n\n\u003e \"The enormity of this restriction is difficult to grasp. It is a little as though the members of a family were not free to make friends outside the family, except when the family as a whole made a friendship.\"\n\n## Why graphs are hard to visualize\nThe example the article used was to try and an orange, a watermelon, a football and a tennis ball. How will you keep them in your mind, in your mind's eye? However you do it, you will do it by grouping them. Maybe two fruits and two sports balls together. In doing so, you construct a tree structure. Maybe you group it by size, two small spheres and two large spheres. This constructs another tree. But try as hard as you like, two trees combined form a semilattice. It is very difficult to hold a semilattice in your head.\n\nMaybe this is where tools like knowledge graphs come in. Allow us to better visually explore these graph relations and allow us to capture more complex relations in things\n\nRegular note taking like Notion is hierarchical and linear → its a tree\nGraph representations like Roam Research, Obsidian allow us to make non-obvious non-hierarchical connections between concepts\n\nCurious if we can apply graph visualization approaches to [social media](thoughts/social%20graphs.md)?\n",

  "/thoughts/Arweave": {
    "title": "Arweave",
    "content": "\n[Blogpost](https://arweave.medium.com/what-is-arweave-explain-like-im-five-425362144eb5) and [Yellowpaper](https://www.arweave.org/yellow-paper.pdf)\n\nArweave uses a [blockchain](thoughts/blockchain.md)-like structure called the blockweave.\n\nHits 5000 transactions per second (compared to 15 on [Ethereum](thoughts/ethereum.md))\n\nWildfire is the Arweave’s self-organising network topology system. Wildfire ensures that miners are selfishly incentivised to store and share data as quickly as possible with other miners in the network, in order to build a positive reputation. While more complex under the hood, Wildfire can be summarised as: ‘if you share with me, I will share with you’. As nodes in blockweave networks require fast access to data in order to mine efficiently, they are selfishly-incentivised to give data to other members of the network promptly and continuously, autonomously improving the sharing to lightning-fast speeds.\n\nThe blockweave solves two fundamental problems currently associated with public decentralised blockchains:\n- On-chain storage constraints; and\n- Unsustainable consensus mechanisms\n\nIn order for an information store to be truly permanent, it must be both [fault tolerant](thoughts/fault%20tolerance.md) and [decentralized](thoughts/decentralization.md). Blockchain technology has much obvious promise in the area of resilient, decentralized information preservation, as a key feature of the technology is that all data inside the blockchain is immutable, and cannot be altered once it is stored. However, traditionally, such technology severely lacks scalability which clearly limits its utility for storing significant quantities of data.\n\nOf especially great importance is users ability to reliably maintain\naccess to all permaweb applications and websites themselves, not simply the\ncontent they display, forever.\n\nRequiring PoA incentivises storage as miners need access to random blocks from the blockweave’s history in order to mine new blocks and receive mining rewards.\n\nUnlike traditional blockchain systems, Arweave does not have a typical notion of full and light clients – merely clients that downloaded more or less of the blockweave. With Arweave, full synchronisation is not a risk or an obligation, but an optional upgrade path for which miners receive higher rewards.\n\nFrom the user’s perspective,  there are two types of transactions in the network:  data transactions and value transactions.  A user can initiate a data transaction to store data in a block.\n\nRather, most of the transaction fee is contributed towards a storage endowment, which is distributed to the wallets of miners over time.\n\nFrom our current position, at an optimistic 30% annual data density growth rate, it will take 434 years to reach the maximum theoretical limit, at 20% – 697 years, at 10% AGR – 1,329 years.\n\nArchive nesting\n- This does not mean that we expect that the information stored inside the weave will be lost after the final block is mined\n- It is our expectation that when eventually a permanent information storage system more suited to the challenges of the time emerges, the Arweave’s data will be ‘subsumed’ into this network.\n- This pattern of ‘nesting’ of archives when they are retired is common across human history. An archive of Gopherspace (a ‘knowledge web’, prior to the HTTP-based web) can be found inside the Arweave’s permaweb. In-side the Gopherspace archive, one can find archives of earlier Telnet and bulletin board-based discussion systems\n\nContent policies\n- Given that the miners collectively maintain the Arweave network, a mechanism is required to allow them to express their opinions on what content should and should not be hosted in the system.\n- Nodes express preferences about content through content policies. Content policies  can  be  arbitrary  computation  performed  upon  transactions  that classify them as acceptable or not acceptable to the local node.  In the reference Arweave implementation, content policies are supported in the form of substring matches as well as hashes of the data stored in the transaction.\n- Two complementary incentives at play here\n\t- An incentive not to over-zealously reject too many transactions, as this would lead to a decline in mining rewards\n\t- An incentive not to accept transactions that the majority of the network is likely to reject, as this will result in mining candidate blocks that the rest of the network will ignore\n\n## Architectures\n### Client-server\nTraditional web or native applications have a client-server architecture. This model is still possible with the Arweave, as a web server can act as a front-end for data stored on the network’s permanent ledger.\n\nIn this centralised Arweave-app model, these services can maintain a pool of AR tokens in order to pay for data storage requests on behalf of the client.\n\n### Serverless\nDecentralised applications reside directly on and operate directly from the blockweave itself, and can be accessed by a typical web browser. \n\nServerless applications hosted on the Arweave network allow users to pay directly  for  their  interactions  with  the  network.   This  frees  the  developer from having to subsidise the cost of user interactions themselves\n\n## DNS\nThe owner of a domain can run a permanently-available, decentralized web application just by storing a transaction on the Arweave network and registering DNS records via the usual external service providers\n\nYou need\n1. A DNS CNAME record pointing to an Arweave gateway: `www CNAME arweave-gateway.net`\n2. A DNS TXT record linking the domain with a specific transaction ID: `arweavetx TXT kTv4OkVtmc0NAsqIcnHfudKjykJeQ83qXXrxf8hrh0S`",

    "title": "Bias in Search",
    "content": "\n*Term paper for INFO303*\n\n\u003e One of the critiques of search engines is a **lack of transparency and potential for bias in their algorithms**.  This issue has become even more critical now that Artificial Intelligence is a core search technology.  Review and critically assess these concerns in light of the growing body of research that seeks to address Algorithmic Bias in search.  What methods are available or proposed to address this issue?\n\n## Part I: a detailed description of the topic or issue\n\nThe scale of the web is huge, spanning many billions of web pages with a wide range of modalities (Teevan \u0026 Dumais in Ruthven \u0026 Kelly, 2011, p. 189). It is obvious that search is important for people to find what they need amidst the sprawling web we call the internet. Search engines connect its users with information resources that meet their information needs (Teevan \u0026 Dumais in Ruthven \u0026 Kelly, 2011, p. 192).\n\nSearch engines, then, are like gateways to the information on the web, allowing easy and universal access to online information to all of its users, and defining what is relevant, knowable, and authoritative. On the other hand, these arbiters of digital information can also create embedded biases that cause knowledge disparity and allow for ill-informed decision making for information-seekers (Gao \u0026 Shah, 2021, p. 2643; Friedman \u0026 Nissenbaum, 1996). \n\nThis paper seeks to critically examine some critique leveraged at these search engines around lack of transparency and potential for bias in their indexing, search, and ranking algorithms and conducts a brief survey over different methods of mitigating or addressing these issues.\n\nFirst, let us cover some basic terminology around what lack of transparency and bias mean in the context of this paper. \n\nIn conjunction with the rise of large language models for understanding queries, search has become very difficult to 'explain'. The problem is no longer understanding a transparent algorithm (like PageRank), but rather finding out exactly *why* the search engine result gave the result it did. Current search engines lack any indication of how they use your personal data to personalize the results, how the language model understands your query, or what determines search ranking. Diakopoulos and Koliska refer to this phenomena as a lack of *algorithmic transparency*. Transparency itself is the disclosure of information about algorithms to enable monitoring, checking, criticism, or intervention by interested parties (Diakopoulos \u0026 Koliska, 2017).\n\nAdditionally, search engines are not the fully neutral, mathematically absolute systems they sometimes claim to be. Instead, they have embedded biases that inherently favour some values over others, for example favouring some types of sites over others in query results. Here, we use Friedman and Nissenbaum's definition of bias from their influential work *Bias in computer systems*: \"[bias refers] to computer systems that systematically and unfairly discriminate against certain individuals or groups of individuals in favour of others... A system discriminates unfairly if it denies an opportunity or a good or if it assigns an undesirable outcome to an individual or group of individuals on grounds that are unreasonable or inappropriate\" (1996, p. 332). For example, the orderings of results themselves can create exposure bias due to their considerable impacts on relevance and click-through rates. It is clear that biases that are woven in search systems are becoming increasing threats to information seeking and sense-making processes (Friedman \u0026 Nissenbaum, 1996).\n\n## Part 2: an analysis of the associated societal benefits/harms and ethical issues\n\nHowever, the impact of these search systems go much deeper than making it hard to find what you are looking for. If these search engines are gatekeepers, then they also influence the values that surround what is being searched for. This means that minority groups often have their own values and identities influenced by the majority: a form of double-consciousness that Safiya Umoja Noble describes in her seminal work *Algorithms of Oppression* (Noble, 2018). If the majority rules in search engine results, then how might those who are in the minority ever be able to influence or control the way they are represented in a search engine?\n\nFurthermore, Ali Alkhatib's work paints an even grimmer possible future where algorithmic systems live in a sort of potemkin village or pseudo-reality of their own construction that they see the world as (Alkhatib, 2021). Large search engine companies like Google have massive stores of personal data in the attempts of modelling and predicting who we are and what we will do next (Pariser in Alkhatib, 2021). In doing so, these algorithmic systems produce a simplified yet inaccurate view of the world. However, the problem is not in creating these models, but from projecting the models onto the world to try and create change. These systems become more actively dangerous when they go from \"making sense of the world\" to \"making the world make sense\" (Alkhatib, 2021).\n\nOf course, this is exactly what these search engines are doing. They attempt to use these models to alter what information they feed to us, which in turn shapes our information seeking behaviour and what we know. Pariser (2011) points out that \"[search personalization] serves up a kind of invisible autopropaganda, indoctrinating us with our own ideas, amplifying our desire for things that are familiar and leaving us oblivious to the dangers lurking in the dark territory of the unknown\".\n\nThe problem is exacerbated when these 'abridged maps' of the world start diverging from reality and people can't override the delusions baked into those imaginations. Echoing Noble's earlier work, this creates vicious cycles of unfairness where users frequently only click on the top results, a ranking or recommendation algorithm that takes user feedback into account will continue putting those same items at the top, reinforcing what the algorithm *believes* to be true about the world. As the power dynamics unfold and play out, the system drifts further and further away from reality (Gao, Ge, \u0026 Shah, 2021). This is why data and power monopolies are so dangerous. These bureaucracies that have no power to self-correct (or allow themselves to be corrected) leads to a world where people cannot freely walk away or reject the bureaucracy's nonsense model of the world (Alkhatib, 2021). If there is no way for the users to speak up and to demand change, then it becomes an Orwellian nightmare where these search engines become sources that dictate *truth*.\n\nThe large scale usage of these search engines have now changed their positions in society from aggregators of information to arbiters and oracles of truth. Historically, search algorithms relied on perhaps complex algorithms but all they did was rank literally whats relevant and ask the user to determine what info they actually need with respect to their query. Now, more search engines are leaning into trying to tell you the 'right' answer in an effort to reduce the number of clicks it takes for the average user to find the answer they are looking for. Yet none of these results are actually *objective.* These engines freely provide \"a sorting of the wheat from the chaff, and answer our most profound and most trivial questions\" and in doing so, become an object of faith (Noble, 2018). Cathy O'Neil likens search engines to objects of faith: \"Like gods, these mathematical models were opaque, their workings invisible to all but the highest priests in their domain: mathematicians and computer scientists\" (2016). Many searchers view the results of these searches as objective truth.\n\nThis misconception of search engines as sources of truth leads to epistemologically irrational behaviour where searchers take the answer of these algorithms without critically examining them or performing their own further research.\n\n## Part 3: a discussion of how the issue can or should be addressed to minimize negative impacts and increase benefits.\n\nWith such a significant problem with one of the most critical pieces of our modern day information seeking, many have attempted to try to mitigate some of the negative impacts of these search systems. The following section briefly surveys a variety of different methods for addressing these problems.\n\n### Fairness-aware Algorithms\nOne such approach are fairness-aware algorithms which aim to integrate metrics of diversity and fairness along with more traditional IR metrics like relevance and novelty. We look to Gao, Ge, and Shah's 2021 work on *FAIR: Fairness-aware information retrieval evaluation* as a case study. \n\nThey define fairness as the subjective moderation of the ratio between different groups (p. 1). This approach to fairness comes from a more social perspective which attempts to moderate the exposure of information so that \"different information and resources get fair chances to receive users' attention\" (p. 2).  They argue that search currently does a poor job of distributing attention across a diverse set of results and that we should look to fairness-aware algorithms where \"different items should receive equal exposure, or exposure proportional to their utilities or impacts\" (p. 3).\n\nTo do so, they propose to optimize directly for an *integrated* metric -- arguing that fairness and utility are not necessarily orthogonal and optimizing for one does not necessarily lead to a decline in quality in another.\n\nOf course, this is not without limitations either. Fairness-aware algorithms like FAIR seem promising but have yet to see more mainstream adoption from large search companies. Additionally, FAIR is designed with a focus on group fairness rather than individual fairness (p. 11), which makes it much more difficult to adapt to the standard of personalized search we see today.\n\n### Algorithmic Transparency\nAnother method is to vie for more explainable search systems. Explainable recommendation and search, as defined by Zhang, Zhang, and Zhang, are \"models or methods that not only generate high-quality recommendation or search results, but also intuitive explanations of the results for users or system designers, which can help to improve the system transparency, persuasiveness, trustworthiness, and effectiveness, etc.\" (p. 1411).\n\nWork done by Rader, Cotter, and Cho show potential for including *explanations* in search rankings and feed as ways of improving algorithmic transparency about how the search engine result arrived at its answer (2018), citing what factors contributed to why certain results appear to users.\n\nHowever, this method is not without critique either. Some mention that revealing the ranking algorithm would lead to catastrophe, given the adversarial stance between search and spammers and SEOs. Granados and Gupta agree, citing that while transparency can be seen as beneficial to engendering trust, \"seeing the inner workings of a government, business, or newsroom can result in negative implications such as undermining competitive advantages or creating costs without concomitant gains\" (Granados \u0026 Gupta cited in Diakopoulos \u0026 Koliska, 2017).\n\nDiakopoulos and Koliska noted that participants in their study recognized this issue but still found it did not detract from the necessity of transparent systems, citing that \"people will game the system no matter what, and that by disclosing information publicly it would level the playing field\" (2017). Leveling the playing field, in this context likely refers to healthy competitive advantage that prevents the same monopolies of power that Alkhatib's work mentioned.\n\n### Algorithmic Accountability\nAnother potential approach is to better hold search engine companies accountable for the results of search rather than making the algorithms themselves explicitly transparent.\n\nKrafft, Reber, Krafft, Coutrier, and Zweig define the concept of algorithmic accountability, which focuses on the behavior of the algorithm or the algorithmic system in question which has to be justified and explained by the person or company who puts it in use (Krafft \u0026 Reber, et al. 2021).\n\nThis approach is more of a 'black-box' approach which doesn't require a transparent understanding of how the algorithmic system works for it to be held accountable, only for the effects to be known. Krafft et. al. specifically note this advantage over approaches that focus on transparency, citing that with accountability approaches, the workings of the algorithms themselves usually \"remain undisclosed or obfuscated by design as they constitute trade secrets whose disclosure would allow gaming the system\" (p. 2).\n\nThe ACM similarly outlines 7 principles for algorithmic transparency and accountability (ACM, 2017): awareness, access and redress, accountability, explanation, data provenance, auditability, and validation and testing. The main focus that the ACM is trying to drive is that groups affected by these algorithmic systems should be able to 1) be aware of biases + risks, 2) have enough context and data to have informed feedback, and 3) have a way to give feedback and hold the systems and their creators accountable.\n\nHaving human and legal entities take responsibility for the actions of their algorithms helps to prevent cases where people blame algorithms and data for being biased in order to shift the responsibility off of themselves. This form of human-in-the-loop computer system helps to prevent the algorithmic model of the world from being too detached from the real one.\n\n### Personal Search Engines\nPerhaps a more radical approach that is less explored in the academic space is one that advocates instead of extreme personalization (and thus bias) in search.\n\nEric Goldman in fact strongly advocates for this approach, suggesting that perhaps problems involving *objectivity* in these search engines that claim to be arbiters of truth to be solved by increasing *subjectivity* through the form of personalization in these results (Goldman, 2008). If each search is tailored to the individual, it is not espousing on *truth* to anyone, it will rather be a suggestion than an objective truth.\n\nGoldman goes on further to say that increasingly personalized search algorithms will \"reduce the effect of search engine bias because there will likely be multiple ‘top’ search results of a particular search term instead of a single winner [and] personalized algorithms will eliminate many of the current concerns about search engine bias\" (p. 130). \n\nSari Azout advocates for a world in which search engines are not universal, but rather boutique and personal (Azout, 2021). The big thing here is that universal search sites like Google use the same interface to search everything, relying on natural language to decipher user intentions. Vertical search players like Yelp/Zillow use domain specific knowledge to take away some of the guessing that universal search needs to go through by encoding it through structured search formats appropriate to the medium.\n\nIn this model of search, search engines are not oracles but rather another opinion for you to consider you in your information-seeking journey.\n\n### Conclusion\nIt does not feel like there is a single 'silver bullet' solution to bias and lack of transparency in the search space. If it was that easy, I'm sure it would have been developed and implemented already. This is clearly a nuanced space with a lot of interplaying factors that make it hard to find any one 'objectively good' solution to these problems.\n\nLike Krafft and Reber mention in their paper analyzing challenges in black box analyses, \"search engines, like most other algorithmic systems embedded in a complex socio-technical system, are not a stable research subject\" (Krafft \u0026 Reber, et al. 2021). The search experience is constantly changing due to companies running A/B tests to optimize their advertisement conversion numbers and user engagement, world events that affect what is popular and searched for, previous search behaviour that affects the engine's model of you and the world (Krafft \u0026 Reber, et al. 2021). These are just a few of the many problems search engine researchers come across when trying to be exact in their science of dissecting and probing these algorithmic systems.\n\nThese systems are so deeply entrenched within our society that there is no way to 'isolate' changes in any one part of the system. It is incredibly hard to prod and fix these issues when they are constantly changing and adapting, but that doesn't mean there hasn't been good attempts in the space to address it. At the end of the day, web search is integral to how we conduct increasingly online portions of our lives. The least we can do is to make sure that it works equitably and well for everyone who needs to use it.\n\n## Citations\n1. Ruthven, I., \u0026 Kelly, D. (Eds.).

New buildings need to be designed with the expectation that they will evolve, because they usually outlive their initial use.

This should be done, for example, by making sure that changing the space layout in the building is possible without changing the structure.\n\n## XAI systems\nIn the last case (organized complexity and non-repetitive digital systems), the complexity of the problem cannot be reduced - we need to consider a large number of interacting processes or components.

    "title": "Consciousness is not Information",
    "content": "\n\u003e Paper #2 for PHIL 451A\n\u003e \n\u003e Prompt 1:  Is consciousness essentially a kind of information?\n\nWhen we examine theories of consciousness, we find that we can divide the majority of theories into two major categories: process theories and vehicle theories[^4]. I further borrow terminology from Velmans[^7] to describe these as behaviourist and cognitivist approaches to consciousness respectively, and argue that consciousness under cognitivist approaches runs into quite a few glaring holes.\n\nLet us first begin by defining the two major categories of theories of consciousness.\n1. Process theories assume that consciousness depends on the functional or relational properties of representational vehicles[^6], namely on the types of computations the vehicles engage in. Process theories are also referred to as cognitivist theorists -- these theories can, without scientific loss, be translated into talk about *information processing*[^7].\n2. Vehicle theories assume that consciousness is determined by intrinsic properties of representational vehicles[^6]. These theories are also referred to as behaviourist theorists -- these theories can, without scientific loss, be translated into talk about *behaviour*[^7].\n\nTo ask whether consciousness is essentially a kind of information is to ask whether the cognitivist theories of consciousness should be considered true. I disagree with the cognitive theories of consciousness as they fail to adequately address several critical questions. To concretize my argument in real theories, I look to Chalmer's process theory[^2] and Tononi's Information Integration Theory[^1].\n\nBoth of these are deeply rooted in cognitivist theories of consciousness. For example, in IIT, consciousness of the system refers to the information generated above and beyond the information generated from the separate parts of the system[^1]. Chalmer's process theory posits that information states can be realized physically and that these information states themselves are conscious[^2].\n\nYet, neither theory completely accounts for:\n1. Defining information in a manner at odds with how information is regularly defined\n2. How a serial [stream of consciousness](thoughts/Stream%20of%20Consciousness.md) can arise from a parallel distributed network\n3. Information carrying in obviously non-conscious objects\n4. Brute optimization of its mathematical definition\n\nWe expand on each of these in turn.\n\nChalmers' process theory starts by defining information in the world as having two aspects, physicality and phenomenality. Information then, is both a physical thing and has phenomenal intentionality (or what is is like to *be* information). In doing so, Chalmers defines information as having the property of being conscious. However, this is quite different from colloquially accepted and typical academic definitions of information. Information usually refers to *non-mental*, mind-independent entities that are embedded *in* the physical (e.g. a book or brain states). Pioneers of information theory like Claude Shannon and even colloquial usage of the term information agree with this definition. An important distinction between these two definitions is that while physical things encode and embed information, they themselves are not information. A book by itself is just an arrangement of paper and ink but it may carry information like the concept of Dante's *Inferno*. Thus, whatever Chalmers claims to be 'information' cannot be the same information everyone else refers to[^4] and so his conclusions on the basis of information cannot be valid.\n\nWe then consider the seriality/stream problem in the context of Chalmers' process theory. The 'stream' character of human conscious experience seems to almost be at odds with the parallel distributed model of the mind with its various synapses and neurons that have no central center for keeping order.  Process theories of consciousness must therefore account for how seriality arises from the distributed nature of the mind[^5]. Chalmers fails to do address this in his theory all-together. It is important to note that behaviourist theories avoid this all-together as behaviour is a *series* (or at least, very limited parallelism) of agent-environment interactions. Agents do not perform multiple complex interactions at once (e.g. eating and playing). Even for multi-tasking of simple interactions, most theories propose the concept of a bottle-neck or limiting capacity -- more complex behaviours take more bandwidth and thus require more focus, required the need for serial execution.\n\nLast but not least, we turn to how Chalmers' refutes information carrying in non-conscious objects. From earlier, Chalmers defines the ability to contain information states as the capacity for consciousness[^2]. Yet, there are clearly non-conscious objects, books for example, that clearly carry information but are not widely accepted as being conscious. Chalmers provides two options:\n1. Perhaps only some kinds of “physically realized information spaces” are conscious.\n2. Perhaps thermostats are conscious.\nChalmers' chooses the second option and suggests that “the level of organization at which consciousness 'winks out' might be lower than a thermostat but higher than a rock.”[^4] The resolution that Chalmers' chose is quite unsatisfying.\n\nTononi attempts to improve on Chalmers' theory by proposing IIT[^4]. In this theory, information is defined as information that is specified by a system that is irreducible to that specified by its parts. That is, information is *integrated* information. In making this distinction, Tononi explicitly rejects Chalmer's choice of distinguishing information-carriers as conscious and instead chooses to define a subset of physically-realized information spaces (*integrated* information) as conscious. In doing so, IIT avoids the first and third pitfalls of Chalmers' theory.\n\nHowever, IIT still has a major flaw in that it only claims to *correlate* integrated information $\\Phi$ with consciousness: \"To recapitulate, the theory claims that consciousness corresponds to the capacity to integrate information.\"[^1] Yet, we know that correlation is most definitely neither definition nor causation. Even while this is a glaring hole in what IIT claims to be, we can continue to show that even the definition of $\\Phi$ itself is problematic.\n\nRoughly, $\\Phi$ is large if the system has a lot interconnection between its components. In more technical terms, it is \"minimizing, over all subdivisions of your physical system into two parts A and B, some measure of the mutual information between A’s outputs and B’s inputs and vice versa.\" [^8] It is worth noting then that *any* sort of device that has some level of interconnection would be slightly conscious. According to Aaronson, Tononi seemed to accept this [panpsychist](thoughts/Panpsychism.md) implication and agree that thermostats have small but nonzero levels of consciousness. This clearly suffers the same unsatisfying conclusion that Chalmers arrived at earlier.\n\nHowever, even more problematic, is the fact that as this is a mathematical formula, it is susceptible to optimization (see: [Goodhart's Law](thoughts/Goodhart's%20Law.md)). Aaronson shows that we can construct almost trivial examples where systems that are clearly not conscious exhibit ridiculously large values of integrated information. For example, we can hook together a large number of logic gates together all in ways that are highly interconnected and achieve levels of $\\Phi$ that imply that over half of the information in the system is integrated information. As these logic gate systems (Aaronson details these as bipartite expander graphs) can be infinitely scalable, one could theoretically construct such a system with unbounded $\\Phi$. Surely there is something problematic going on if we can say that a graph of logic gates is infinitely conscious.\n\nIt is clear that information and information-processing based methods are brittle. Of course, there are alternatives to consider like Boris Kotchoubey's behaviourist approaches to consciousness that I believe are more sound, it is outside the scope of this paper to discuss their viability. Earlier, we posited that cognitive theories consciousness rely on consciousness as information or information-processing. In conclusion, I have shown that key cognitivist theories of consciousness like Chalmer's theory and Tononi's IIT have glaring flaws in attempting to measure and define consciousness. Thus, consciousness should not be considered a kind of information.\n\n[^1]: Tononi, Giulio (2004). *An information integration theory of consciousness*\n[^2]: Chalmers, D. J.

Some experiences are deceptive (e.g. visual illusions, mirages)\n    2.  Any particular experience I have might be deceptive\n    3.  It is possible that _all_ my experiences are deceptive\n-  Counterexample to first argument\n    -  Some paintings are forgeries\n    -  Any particular painting might be a forgery\n    -  It is possible that all paintings are forgeries\n    -  Can't be possible because all paintings if all paintings are forgeries, what are they based off of?\n    - Cannot dream things that have no component real parts (even mermaids, for example are part women and fish)\n    - Some universal axioms still hold\n\t    - \"For whether I am awake or asleep, two plus three make five, and a square does not have more than four sides.\" (p. 15)\n-  Descartes' objection to First Argument\n    - Premise 2 doesn't work → any particular experience I have might be deceptive\n    -  I am sure of my own thoughts\n        -  And yet to have these doubts, one must exist. For an evil demon to mislead him in all these insidious ways, he must exist in order to be misled.\n        -  Therefore, thought above all else is inseparable from being. The Meditator concludes that, in the strict sense, he is only a thing that thinks.\n### Dream Argument\n-   Premises\n\t1.  I have dreamt at being at my desk\n\t2. When I dreamt it, I believed it was true\n\t3. When I dreamt it, it was false\n\t4. There is no way to tell whether you are dreaming or awake\n-  Conclusion → i don't know that I am here at my desk right now\n-  As premise 4 is roughly equivalent to the conclusion, this argument is invalid\n\t- It begs the question → argument which has a premise as a conclusion (circular reasoning)\n### The God argument\n-   suppose there exists an evil demon, just as powerful as God, but which deceives me about everything he can\n-   descartes refutation\n\t-   it seems possible for there to be such a person\n\t-   if there were such a person, then everything I believe would be false\n\t-   I can't tell that there isn't such a person\n\t-   so, I don't really know anything I thought i knew\n## Second Meditation\n- *I am, I exist* is necessarily true whenever it is put forward by me or conceived in my mind\n\t- For one to be deceived, one must first exist\n- What is \"I\"?\n\t- Soul and body can be deceptions\n\t- Thought then, above all else, is inseparable from being\n### Wax Argument\n- On how we come to know of a piece of wax\n- Cannot come to know it through means of the senses\n\t- Put it near a fire and its perception by the senses changes (e.g. becomes soft when it was hard)\n- Cannot come to know it through imagination\n\t- One cannot imagine all the infinite number of different shapes in their imagination\n- Must be through means of intellect alone\n\t- Similar to seeing a man as a post (more in [epistemology](thoughts/epistemology.md))\n- The Meditator happily concludes that he can know at least that he exists, that he is a thinking thing, that his mind is better known than his body, and that all clear and distinct perceptions come by means of the intellect alone, and not the senses or the imagination.\n## Third Meditation\n- To assure himself that he is not deceived, he must inquire into the nature of God\n- Before doing this, the Meditator needs to classify his thoughts\n\t- Ideas: images of things\n\t\t- 3 sources for ideas\n\t\t\t1. Innate\n\t\t\t2. Adventitious: coming from 'outside' us (as with our sensory perceptions)\n\t\t\t\t- His will has no effect on adventitious ideas: he cannot prevent himself from feeling hot when it is hot simply through the will, for instance.\n\t\t\t3. Invented\n\t- Volitions, emotions, judgements: idea is the object of the thought, and a further thing such as an affirmation or a fear which is directed towards the object of thought\n- One of the grave mistakes is to judge the ideas in one's mind to be accurate resemblances of things outside the mind (if they do even exist)\n\t- Thus the meditator considers ideas in the mind only as modes of thought\n- Ideas, as modes of thought, all have the same amount of formal reality (reality intrinsic to themselves) but their objective reality differs greatly\n\t- For Descartes and the Scholastics, ideas are the link that connect mind and world because they have both formal and objective reality.\n\t- Can think about this like dividing reality into a scale where infinite substances (like God) have the most reality, followed by finite substances (bodies and minds), followed by modes (modifications of body and mind -- e.g. colour, shape, size, etc.).\n\t\t- Ideas then, have the formal reality of modes (as they are modifications of the mind) but objective reality of a finite substance (car is a body)\n- No effect can have a greater amount of reality than its cause\n\t- The idea of a stone, then, could be caused by a stone or a large rock but it could not be caused by a colour \n\t- If the meditator can locate an idea with more objective reality than he has formal reality (finite substance). The only thing with more reality is infinite substance or the idea of God\n- [qualia](thoughts/qualia.md) can only be perceived in a confused and obscure way, so if they are things, they must have small degree of reality as to originate unproblematically from the Meditator himself\n### Existence of God\n- As the Meditator cannot have originated the concept of God (which has infinite substance), God must be the cause of this idea and must therefore exist\n\t- Could God not just be in contrast to his own finite being?\n\t- We would not be aware of a lack unless we were aware of a more perfect being and God is the ultimate perfect being\n\t- You can't actually get the idea of infinity just from endlessly increasing what's finite, so the infinite must independently exist (p. 32)\n- Could the Meditator themselves be supremely perfect?\n\t- If this is the case, it is plausible that the idea of God could be conceived in him without any outside cause\n\t- Rejects this for 3 reasons\n\t\t1. God is all actual and not potential\n\t\t2. If he is constantly improving, he will never attain perfection while there is room for improvement\n\t\t3. Potential is not being at all\n- The Meditator seems committed to claiming both (a) that we can only be sure of our clear and distinct perceptions if God exists and (b) we can know that God exists because we clearly and distinctly perceive the idea of God. If both (a) and (b) are true, Descartes is guilty of circular reasoning.\n## Fourth Meditation\n- If God has endowed him with infallible judgment, how is it that he can be mistaken, as he undoubtedly is from time to time\n- If God is a perfect creator, God should be able to create perfect beings\n\t- The Lord works in mysterious ways -- we should not seek to understand the true motives of God (?)\n\t- We are only a small part of a much larger creation\n- Descartes is a proponent of free will\n\t- The will is free to affirm or deny whatever it wishes -- as such, free will is the source of error\n\t- If there was no free will, we would never make mistakes\n## Fifth Meditation\n- God exists as an idea in the Meditators mind and he clearly and distinctly perceives all of his qualities. One of these qualities is existence, then God would not be God if he did not exist. (just as a triangle only exists if it has the property of being three-sided)\n- At the very least, then, the existence of God must be as certain as the properties of mathematical and geometrical objects since he can prove them in the same way.\n\n\n\n## Essay\n*Evaluate Descartes' assertion that God, as a perfect being, cannot be a deceiver. Note that some of his logic is implicit in his idea of perfection. Note that to evaluate an argument, you need to first explain the argument, and then say why it is or is not successful.*\n\nDescartes, in his meditations, wishes to find a foundation of knowledge that will still stand strong even after doubting the most basic facts about the world. In doing so, he starts by methodically doubting all things that he has \"less than complete certainty\" of. He casts asides sensory experience, claiming that these can be deceived. Even objects close by could be illusory as he could be dreaming. Even basic axioms of the world like mathematics could be false because of some evil genius that has \"employed all his energies in order to deceive me\". Iteratively, he tries to re-prove existence of many things, starting from the existence of self (*\"cogito, ergo sum\"*) and progressing towards an argument for the existence of God (and god as a perfect being who cannot be a deceiver.)\n\nIn the Fifth Meditation, Descartes presents the argument as follows:\n1.  Suppose there is a supremely perfect being -- a being that has every possible 'perfect' trait. A supremely perfect being *must* have every possible perfect trait because to exclude any or all perfections from a supremely perfect being is to stumble into a contradiction or to \"conceive of a mountain without a valley\".\n2. Necessary existence is a perfection. It is an existence where one depends only on [the self](thoughts/the%20Self.md) for existence (similar to the concept of independent origination in [emptiness](thoughts/emptiness.md)).\n3. Necessary existence cannot be separated from the essence of a supremely perfect being.\n4. Therefore, a supremely perfect being exists -- it is God.\n\nHowever, this argument is flawed as it begs the question -- the premise (that there exists a supremely perfect being) is also the conclusion (a supremely perfect being exists). This inherent circular argument then does not hold.\n\nFor the sake of continued examination of the argument, let us assume that this argument is sound, and that God indeed does exist.\n\nDescartes goes on to utilize the statement that God exists to prove that God cannot be a deceiver.\n\n1. God exists and is perfect\n2. Deception is imperfect, therefore God cannot deceive\n3. Whatever I perceive \"clearly and distinctly\" must be true\n4. As my perception is clear, the material world must exist\n\nHowever, this argument also begs the question as it relies on the first proof that God necessarily exists as a premise. Unfortunately, Descartes first proof relies on the fact that Descartes has a clear and distinct idea of God, which presupposes clear and distinct perception (the conclusion of this argument). Thus, to show that his perception is clear, he must assume that his perception is clear -- clearly an invalid argument.",

    "title": "Design Justice",
    "content": "\n## Summary\nDesign Justice focuses not just on design in the visual and aesthetic sense, but also on the design of systems.\n\nTo quote from the book, \"Design justice rethinks design processes, centers people who are normally marginalized by design, and uses collaborative, creative practices to address the deepest challenges our communities face.\" The norms, values, and assumptions that are encoded and reproduced in the *design* of systems can be changed by rethinking our design processes.\n\nIn less than 400 short pages, Sasha Costanza-Chock covers a breadth of topics ranging from intersectionality, bias, and universal design to maintenance, design sites, and technosolutionism -- all through detailed case studies of real-world design practices and social movements.\n\nShe guides the reader into how the 'unmarked user' and universal design erases certain groups of people within the matrix of domination (through ableist, eurocentric, and classist assumptions) and refutes the argument that 'design by committee produces mediocrity.'\n\nDesign Justice is a book that invites us to \"center people who are too often marginalized by design\". More importantly, it urges us to work towards an equitable world for everyone: one which treats design justice not as a funnel that we use to limit ourselves to a minimal set of supposedly universal design choices, but rather as a prism through which to generate a far wider rainbow of possible choices, each better tailored to reflect the needs of a specific group of people.\n\n## Reflection\nDesign sites are valorized as places of learning, making, and building and the intersection of social movements and the counterculture. Why then, have they become increasingly corporate places of extraction of free labour?\n\nThis cooptation of [hacker](thoughts/Hackers.md) culture, hackathons as design sites in particular, by neoliberalism has been on the back of my mind ever since reading the chapter on design sites in Design Justice. As someone who first got their footing in computer science through hackathons, it pains me to see that this is the rep that hackathons have slowly gotten over time, moving from safe spaces for idea exploration to increasingly corporate, time-bound, events where hackers spin up apps to test company products in exchange for the slim chance of winning prizes and recognition.\n\nHackathons reshape precarious and unpaid work. Writing code and building apps for free becomes an extraordinary opportunity and a collective imagination for fictional expectations of innovation that benefits all. Do we so necessarily need to tie these rituals of play in building and tinkering to the recruiting and product testing pipeline for large corporations?\n\nAs a hackathon organizer, Design Justice has helped me to more actively think about what hackathons are trying to motivate. Having more of the tools to articulate and locate exactly why hackathons have felt increasingly corporate is the first step to reinstate hackathons as third spaces not as places of creation or competition, but as places of play and exploration.\n\n## Quotes\n### Defining Design Justice\nHow larger systems -- including norms, values, and assumptions -- are encoded in and reproduced through the design of sociotechnical systems. ([Do Artifacts Have Politics](thoughts/Do%20Artifacts%20Have%20Politics.md))\n\nDesign justice rethinks design processes, centers people who are normally marginalized by design, and uses collaborative, creative practices to address the deepest challenges our communities face\n\nDesign justice is a framework for analysis of how design distributes benefits and burdges between various groups of people.\n\nDesign (noun): A plan or scheme conceived in the mind and intended for subsequent execution; the preliminary conception of an idea that is to carried into effect by action; a project. (Oxford English Dictionary)\n\nTrue, everyone designs, but only certain kinds of design work are acknowledged, valorized, remunerated, and credited. Though all humans design, not everyone gets paid to do so.\n\n*Affordance* refers to \"the perceived and actual properties of the thing, primarily those fundamental properties that determine just how the thing could possibly be used.\" ... An object's affordances are never equally perceptible to all, and never equally available to all.\n\n### On Intersectionality\nBlock women workers at GM were told they had no legal grounds for a discrimination case against their employer because antidiscrimination law only protected single-identity categories.\n\nThe concept of intersectionality provided the grounds for a long, slow paradigm shift that is still unfolding in the social sciences, in legal scholarship, and in other domains of research and practice.\n\nWhile there is rapidly growing interest in algorithmic bias audits, especially in the fairness, accoutnability, and transparency in machine learning (FAT*) community, most are single-axis: they look for a biased distribution of error rates only according to a single variable, such as race or gender.\n\nOne question about [intersectional approaches] is how many identity variables to include because each adds complexity (and, in many situations, time and cost) to audits.\n\n### Universal Design\nUniversal Design (UD) as defined by Center for UD at North Carolina State University: The design of products and environment to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design\n\nAt least in the digital domain, adaptive design that enables personalization and flexible configuration of shared core objects, tools, platforms, and systems provides a path out of the tension between the diverse needs of individual users and the economic advantages of a large-scale user base.\n\nUniversalization erases difference and produces self-reinforcing spirals of exclusion, but personalized and culturally adawptive systems too often are deployed in ways that reinforce [surveillance capitalism](thoughts/Data%20Capitalism.md).\n\nWe should destabilize the underlying assumption that what is best for the majority of users is best for *all* users.\n\n### The Unmarked User\nDesigners most frequently assume that the unmarked user has access to several very powerful privileges, such as US citizenship, English language proficiency, access to broadband internet, a smartphone, a normatively abled body, and so on.\n\nFor broader reasons of structural inequality, the universe of real-world users falls within a limited range compared to the full breadth of *potential* users, then [user-centered design](thoughts/human%20centered%20design.md) reproduces exclusion by centering their needs.\n\n### Disability Simulation\nThese 'simulations' produce an unrealistic understanding of the life experience of disability for a number of reasons: the nondisabled person does not have the alternate skill sets developed by [disabled people], and thus overestimates the loss of function which disability presents, and is furthermore likely to think of able-normative solutions rather than solutions more attuned to a [disabled person's] life experience\n\nDisability simulation is discredited; lived experience is nontransferable. \"Don't start by building a new table; start by coming to the table\"\n\n### Dismantling Existing Systems\ni.e. what's wrong with colour blindness\n\n\"Under this new rhetoric of colour-blindness, equality means treating all individuals the same, regardless of differences they brought with them due to the effects of past discrimination or even discrimination in other venues\"\n\nNew Jim Code\nAlgorithmic decision systems based on historical data sets reinforce white seupremacy and discrimination even as they are positioned by their designers as \"fair\"\n\nRacial hierarchies can only be dismantled by actively antiracist systems design, not by pretending they don't exist.\n\nFar too often, user personas are created out of thin air by members of the design team, based on their own assumption or stereotypes about groups of people. When this happens, user personas are literally objectified assumptions about end users.\n\n### [Maintenance](thoughts/maintenance.md)\n\n[Creating new vs maintaing old](thoughts/creation%20vs%20maintenance.md)\n- Contributing to an existing project requires contacting and negotiating with the existing developers, maintainers, and community. Creating someething new produces attribution, credit, and visibility for its developers, whereas attribution, credit, and visibility for participating in an existing project must, at the very least, be shared.\n- Support maintenance, not just \"innovation.\" Significant resources are necessary to maintain and improve existing movement tech, but most focus is on the creation of new projects.\n\n\"Those of us working to promote universal access to clean water and sanitation must keep our eyes not just on the competition and prizes, but on the less glamorous work of encouraging adoption, usage, and maintenace\"\n\n### Technosolutionism/Technochauvinism\nNew technology will save us!!\n\nAn exclusionary and elitist understanding of what technology is and where it comes from and a lack of interest in preexisting, community-based desigbn practices.\n\n\"... where we are wholly dependent on a handful of extraordinarily gifted entrepreneurs to lead us out of the dark ages. This is a myth.\"\n\nFirst, it contains a somewhat masked normative assumption that \"technology adoption\" is always a good thing.\n\nNeoliberal, technocentric ideas about the city as a machine or as a software system waiting to be optimized have become increasingly prominent. Citizens should not be reduced to users through the lens of neoliberal governmentality.\n\nFirst consider what already works at the community level, and to steer students away from the pitfalls of tech solutionism and technochauvanism\n\n### [Attention economy](thoughts/attention%20economy.md)\n\nMediated visibility has become an important form of capital. Attention (time) is a scarce resource within late-stage informational capitalism, and its allocation has significant symbolic and material impacts.\n\n\"Design challenges\" in which dozens, sometimes hundreds, of people do free labour and submit ideas in hopes that they'll be the lucky one chosen to receive visibility, recognition, and possibly even compensation.\n\n### Design Sites\nTracing the cooptation of hacker culture by neoliberalism\n\nInvisibility of subaltern communites may also be strategic. Sometimes, they shield their practices and innovations from mainstream visibility to avoid incorporation and appropriation.\n\n\"Alternative spaces and forms of living provided interesting ideas could be milked and marketed. So certain structural features of these 'indie' movement outputs were suddenly highly acclaimed, applied, and copy-pasted into capitalist developing laboratories\" ([Post-It Note City](thoughts/Post-It%20Note%20City.md))\n\nHackspaces in the European context, which they describe as originally being \"third spaces\" outside of the logic of both the communist state and the capitalist market. \n\nThe assumption that making sites \"open\" makes them inclusive, without specifically addressing race, class, gender, and/or disability dynamics, is common to many privileged design sites.\n\nMany who are active in these design sites feel themselves to be participants in *commons-based peer production,* or \"decentralized, collaborative, and non-proprietary; base on sharing resources and outputs among widely distributed, loosely connected individuals who cooperate with each other without relying on either market signals or managerial commands\"\n\nWithout intentional intervention, these spaces find it very difficult to fulfill even their own liberal democratic rhetoric because they end up dominated by white cis men and by middle-class people with free time and disposable income.\n\nMore on hackathons: [hackathons](posts/hackathons.md)\n\n#### Hackathons: The Bad\n\nHackathons are understood by corporate managers as potentially effective ways to identify new talent, and therefore as a possible mechanism in the tech sector hiring pipeline. \n\n\"Hackathons, time-bounded events where participants write computer code and build apps, have become a popular means of socializing tech students and workers to produce 'innovation' despite little promise of material reward... [they] reshape unpaid and precarious work as an extraordinary opportunity, a ritual of ecstatic labour, and a collective imaginary for fictional expectations of innovation that benefits all, a powerful strategy for manufacturing works' consent in the 'new' economy.\" (Sharon Zukin and Max Papadantonakis)\n\nHackathons provide excellent opportunities for the extraction of free labour.\n\nThe assumption that a \"hackathon for good\" will be successful if it produces a new app that can help \"solve\" a social problem runs deep.\n\nHackathons nearly always focus on problems and rarely build on existing community assets; and people thing hackathons can do things that they usually can't, such as solve big or even little problems, create new products overnight, or 'level the playing field' of innovation through meritocracy. \"A one day hack for homelessness takes away from the complexity of social justice issues. ... You can't just come up with an app and solve the world's problems\"\n\n\"Hackathon spaces cultivate a culture that marginalizes hackers with specific needs, including but not limited to women, people with disabilities, people with non-traditional backgrounds, and even individuals with specific dietary restrictions. By consistently ignoring the health, diet, and care needs of diverse attendees, along with needs based on skill, class, and gender identities, hackathons create an exclusive and hostile environment.\"\n\n#### Hackathons: The Good\nThey are often crucibles of intense and focused learning, making, problem-solving, communtiy building, and play.\n\n\"In the old days people used to form teams and rush in and try to fix things, without really even knowing what was broken ... it is no longer just a bunch of programmers in a room. There are now hackathons where actual community members are learning to code and interacting. ... Community members are also teaching programmers about the things they need to sustain and build for the future. That's a really good thing happening\"\n\nSuch hackathons push hackers to reflect on why they are doing the work they do, push for the ideas and welfare of marginalized communities in the tech sphere, and do so on the terms of their wellbeing and safety.\n\nOrganizers should pay attention to participants as whole human beings. For example, this means that it is important to consider food, bio breaks, accessible bathrooms that are friendly to all body types and genders, comfortable spaces to nap or relax, and decent lighting, etc.\n\n### Design Justice Pedagogies\n\"Critical pedagogy, where the role of the educator is to pose problems, create spaces for the collective development of critical consciousness, help to develop plans for action to make the world a better place, and develop a sense of agency among learners\"\n\n\"No one knows everything, but together we know a lot, if we listen to each other\"\n\nKey elements\n* Teach data science in a way that honours context, respects situated knowledge, and makes it clear that data is never \"raw\".\n* Emphasize the user of data to create shared meaning over individual mastery.\n* Teach data science that values not only reason, but ethics and emotions as well\n\n### Critiques\n\"Design by commitee produces mediocrity\" or \"we don't want to end up with the lowest-common-denominator design!\"\n\nIt's true that design justice practitioners have to take care that critique does not become our primary activity; an overemphasis on testing, evaluation, and critique can indeed be ultimately disempowering. At the same time, explicit critique paired with alternative proposals can be very productive.\n\nDesign justice doesn't imply that we must somehow reduce our options to only those that satisfy all accessibility criteria for the most marginalized within the matrix of domination. It is not meant to be a *filter* that we use to eliminate most design possibilities from consideration because they fail an accessibility checklist. In fact, design justice as a framework is meant to do the opposite: to act not as a funnel that we use to limit ourselves to a minimal set of supposedly universal design choics, but rather as a prism through which to generate a far wider rainbow of possible choices, each better tailored to reflect the needs of a specific group of people.",

In a sense, *Catalog* and *Supplement* became town squares.\n\nMuch as the dancers at the Trips Festival had imagined that LSD would allow them to escape their bodies and enjoy a new form of communion, scholars and reporters began to describe computer-mediated communication as a form of interaction in which bodies had ceased to matter.\n\n### Comprehensive Designers\n[Contact Language](thoughts/boundary%20object.md) which to exchange ideas and techniques in linguistically distinct tribes (e.g. scientists, technologists, and administrators)\n\n\"The Comprehensive Designer not only did not need to don a gray flannel suit when he went to work; he actually needed to become an artist and intellectual migrant. To a generation preoccupied with the fear of becoming lockstep corporate adults on the military model of Brand's imagined Soviet Army, Buckminster Fuller offered a marvelously playful alternative\"\n\n\"How you get energy is, you take polarities and slap them next to one another. If you get into cybernetics and your head is just a minute ago full of organic gardening and ecology, then cybernetics starts to come alive for you in a different way.\"\n\n### Network Forums\nNetwork Forum -- a palce where members of different communities come together, exchanging ideas and legitimacy, and in the process, synthesizing new intellectual frameworks and new social networks.\n\nNetwork entrepreneur: one who migrates from one intellectual community to another and, in the process, to knit together formerly separate intellectual and social networks.\n\n\"We thought of the WEC as a print version of what the Internet was going to be\"\n\n### Computational Metaphor\nOn the computational metaphor (seeing everything as [computable](thoughts/computability.md))\n\"We are compiling a vocabulary and a syntax that is able to describe in a single language all kinds of phenomenon that have escaped a common language until now. It is a new universal metaphor. It hasm ore juice in it than previous metaphors: Freud's dream state, Darwin's variety, Marx's progress, or the Age of Aquarius. And it has more power than anything else in science at the moment. In fact the computational metaphor may eclipse mathematics as a form of universal notation.\"\n\"Society as a whole, as well as its constituent organizational parts, functioned much like organisms and machines.\"\n\n\"The principles governing the world of the soft -- the world of intagibles, of media, of software, and of services -- will soon command the world of the hard -- the world of reality, of atoms, of objects, of steel and oil, and the hard work done by the sweat of brows.\" -- New Rules for the New Economy\n\nTechnocracy, technostructure, or technological society: society's rapid process of centralization and rationalization as both supported by new technologies and designed to help build them.\n\nSante Fe Institute: founded in 1984 by a group of scientists who had come to believe that since WWII, the biological, physical, and socila sciences had begun to converge. Computers, they argued, had made this convergence possible in two ways: first, they had served as tools for examining and modeling the world, and, second, the algorithms with which they organized information mimicked the algorithmic patterning of life itself by means of biological \"technologies\" such as DNA.\n\n### Neocolonialism\n\"[The hippie's] arrival tapped into memories of very old patterns of colonization and migration. A chicano member of New Mexico's Reality Construction Company commune told a visiting reporter, 'every time a white hippie comes in a buys a Chicano's land to escape the fuckin' city, he sends that Chicano *to* the city to go through what he's trying to escape *from*, can you dig it?... Then when that money's gone, see, the Chicano has to *stay* in the city, cause now he ain't got no land to come back to.\"\n\n### Power Hierarchies and Individualism\n\"Brand suggests that top-down politics (i.e. the kind where Mr. Advantage tells Mr. Disadvantage what to do) is backrupt. The center of change must be the individual, acting with other likeminded individuals. This emphasis on local action echoes the notion of the individual's local role in maintaining universal systems.\"\n\nWEC seems to promote an incredibly individualistic approach; Indians must work with Indians, the Third World with the Third Wolrd, blacks with blacks, and so on. No group should count on help from any other... Such segregation might seem to conflict with the WEC's celebration of 'whole' systems. This seems to be an artifact of the fact that all members of the WEC were white and relatively young, iwth a high level of education and easy access to social and financial resources.\n\n\"The great machines of empire had been miniturized and turned over to individuals, and so transformed into tools with which individuals could improve their own lives.\"\n\n\"As a variety of economic sociologists have noted, the mid-1980s saw hierarchical firms in many industries and several nations reorganize themselves as project oriented networks. They laid off workers, broke component elements of firms into semi-independent project teams, and decentralized their management structure.\"\n\n\"Although the hive had a queen, he pointed out it was governed by the rule-driven behaviour of its many members.

Should be a universal system.\n-   War brought different people from different disciplines together and had a shared communication medium of code\n\n### What was the counterculture?\n\n-   People in 50s and 60s protesting because worried about being turned into information\n-   Two distinct movements (both are anti-bureaucracy, anti-big tech, anti-mass culture)\n    -   New Left (political)\n        -   Struggle\n        -   Leaders, Parties\n    -   New Communalists (internal consciousness, mindset)\n        -   Deeply anchored in the dreams of the cyberneticists\n        -   Technocrats of control via communication (banger)\n        -   Communes (literally in the name)\n-   Why were the 50's kids so enamoured with technology?\n    -   Kids of the counterculture\n    -   Keep the tech made from the way but throw away the culture of the time\n-   When you take away bureaucracy you don't get freedom but 'rule by cool' → disastrous for a democratic society\n\n### Did the New Left have any effect on Cyberculture?\n\n-   Folks on new left will say they did → Computers fulfilled agreement\n-   Communalists had more contribution in tech world\n-   Communes were disasters, didn't last long, living in California\n-   Computer industry was booming\n-   Stanford = hotbed of creative LSD ingestion (damn wtf)\n    -   reboot group trip when?\n-   Steward Brand in 1984 as an Apple Mac, create a society of consciousness\n    -   Mac (as a metaphor for tech) is the new LSD → ability to remove the importance of the physical self\n\n### How much of the shift was a result of WEC? How much you see importance of media / social networking vs technical revolution?\n-   WEC was not a marketplace, rather an aggregator of information (a pre-Google search engine)\n-   What tools do you want to bring to a commune (ex: farming commune)\n    -   Food, housing, basics\n-   Why would you need a calculator and a book on cybernetics on a farm?\n    -   Tools which allow you to fundamentally understand the world in a different way\n    -   Appropriation!\n-   Catalogue provides the infrastructure → leads to conferences which lead to development of more infrastructure\n-   Network Entrepreneur sees several decentralized groups that aren't connected and services as a connector\n\n### Connection between WEC and WELL\n-   picture yourself as a hippie in the 1980's, communes will save the world and end warmaking America\n    -   California is tech driven, everything is failing\n    -   Black panthers have been crushed\n-   Howard Rheingold (the virtual community → on wiki someone find it)\n-   Electronic Frontier → empty society/land of consciousness\n-   Larry Bird, most influential people in silicon valley\n\n### Our current state seems somewhat inevitable, were there any inflection points along the way that could have changed the direction\n-   Counterculture legitimates a project that is already underway\n-   Different in ways that we don't talk about as much\n    -   Gone right\n        -   The power of email, allows you to have institutional and parainstitutional ties\n        -   The power of search, reams of first hand information instantly\n    -   Gone wrong\n        -   Economics of [incentives](thoughts/incentives.md) and bad actors\n        -   Individuating users and centralize control of information, enables advertising en masse\n            -   Although it predates technology via TV and radio, amplified by\n    -   Government have to intervene, like oil companies mining our social world\n        -   Must let go of communalist dream of collective consciousness\n\n### Era of connected machines → connected humans\n-   Enabled by technological development\n-   Can this be beneficial for everyone rather than just the privileged?\n-   Tech that has been sold to us as devices of personal empowered\n    -   not only corporate sponsored but also partnered with the state\n    -   intersection of Big Tech and the state is an uh oh → military industrial complex never really goes away\n\n### Where is todays counterculture\n-   Not the left, but actually the right\n-   Concern is not big data and ML but with corporations and states\n-   Place of rebellion is not at the data level but at the institution and union level (in big corporations) + legal level (ex: protection of Uber drivers)\n-   There are bodies and factories and server farms → lets not forget the basis of our abstractions\n\n### What can we learn from the promises/pitfalls of Steward Brand\n-   Performative politics\n    -   false belief that finding ourselves in our mid 20s is gonna change the world\n    -   rather, by engaging and learning from people who are vastly different from us, BE political\n    -   don't isolate, break out and do politics\n-   don't build communities of consciousness\n    -   build places of exchange, places where public decision making and CHANGE happens",

    "content": "\n## Steven Levy\n[Source: *Hackers* by Steven Levy](https://classes.visitsteve.com/hacking/wp-content/Steven-Levy-Hackers-ch1+2.pdf)\n\nThe hacker ethic: sharing, openness, [decentralization](thoughts/decentralization.md), and getting your hands on machines at any cost to improve the machines and to improve the world. All information should be free.\n\nSqueezing in time where no one else would (sniping people even 1 min late at 3am in the morning). This culture seemed to almost arise bottom-up from the scarcity of compute resources at the early 60s and 70s, especially around the MIT area where there seemed to be a lot more spare compute time and just really smart, curious people.\n\n\u003e What was a computer but something that benefited from a free flow of information?\n### Decentralization\nThe best way to promote free exchange of information is to have an open system, one with no boundaries attached. The worst thing to encourage this is to have a bureaucracy.\n\nThe difference between bureaucrats and and logical algorithms are that bureaucrats follow *arbitrary rules* whereas algorithms follow *concrete and transparent* rules.\n\n## Paul Graham\n[Source: Hackers and Painters by *Paul Graham*](http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html)\n\nThe art of hacking: for building and exploring for the sake of building and exploring.\n\n### Hacking as a creative art\n\u003e They seemed to think that hacking and painting were very different kinds of work-- that hacking was cold, precise, and methodical, and that painting was the frenzied expression of some primal urge.\nPG is positing that hacking (traditionally seen as more as more mechanical) and painting (seen as more creative) have a lot in common -- most importantly, the face that they make things.\n\nFor hackers, computers are just the medium through which they express themselves.\n\nNamely, they don't exclusively try for exclusively [creating or maintaining](thoughts/creation%20vs%20maintenance.md) but rather to make 'good things' and if either of those happen along the way, all the better.\n\n### [Labels](thoughts/quantization.md)\n\u003e But often this mismatch [between labels and what they do] causes problems. It's easy to drift away from building beautiful things toward building ugly things that make more suitable subjects for research papers.\nLabels are logically [decentralized](thoughts/decentralization.md) so if it no longer is useful, then it will phase itself out. While yes, language is useful for defining norms externally, for those *strongly* intrinsically motivated (which arguably are the people PG is trying to speak to), those labels don't matter because external incentives matter very little to them. If that label continues to be useful to them (e.g. to secure funding or to talk about it to laypeople) then why not continue to use it? \n\nI think my case for this argument would be slightly different if PG focused more on the *public* perception of the label.\n\n### [Academia](thoughts/academia.md)\n1. Research must be original -- this drives people to stake out a piece of ground no one wants\n2. Research must be substantial -- awkard problems mean more substance to write about and solve, discouraging elegant solutions\n\nMaybe because better incentive systems are so much harder to create and evaluate. Numbers are easy and an easy test that kind-of works is really tempting to stick with.\n\n### Industry\n\"Universities and research labs force hackers to be scientists, and companies force them to be engineers... Programmers were seen as technicians who translated the visions (if that is the word) of product managers into code.\" (re: [academia](thoughts/academia.md))\n\nThis feels like a problem of scale: only a small percentage of hackers *can* actually design software and it's hard for people running a company to pick these out\n\nBig companies want to damp oscillation/standard deviation of results, they have shareholders to which they are accountable. They win by sucking less than their competitors, not making great products.\n\n\"But when you damp oscillations, you lose the high points as well as the low.\" ([Vanilla Ice Cream effect](thoughts/Vanilla%20Ice%20Cream%20effect.md))\n\n### Figuring things out as you go\n\n\u003e If I had only looked over at the other makers, the painters or the architects, I would have realized that there was a name for what I was doing: sketching.\nThe traditional approach is to logically plan things out and to create with intention. PG argues that sketching -- figuring out the program as one writes it -- is just as valid.\n\nA programming language is for thinking of programs, not for expressing programs you've already thought of. The argument *against* strong typing is really interesting. I like to think of strong typing as ruler lines or a guide to ensure that the perspective of my drawing is right; a good aid to ensure that I'm on the right track. \n\nHackers also learn by doing. Hackers, from the start, are doing original work; it's just very bad. They start original, and get good. On the contrary, academics and scientists start good and get original.\n\n### Demand\n\u003e Prices are determined by supply and demand, and there is just not as much demand for things that are fun to work on as there is for things that solve the mundane problems of individual customers.\nSimilar to [creation vs maintenance](thoughts/creation%20vs%20maintenance.md), there seems to be a need to artificially incentivize the difficult work (e.g. [maintenance](thoughts/maintenance.md) or mundane problems)",

To do this means refusing the frame of reference: in this case, a frame of reference in which value is determined by productivity, the strength of one's career, and individual entrepreneurship. It means embracing and trying to inhabit somewhat fuzzier or blobbier ideas: of [maintenance](thoughts/creation%20vs%20maintenance.md) as productivity, of the importance of nonverbal communication, and of the mere experience of life as the highest goal.\n\nHow do we even begin to define productivity? Productivity that produces what? Successful in what way, and for whom? The happiest, most fulfilled moments of my life have been when I was completely aware of being alive, with all the hope, pain, sorrow that that entails for any mortal being.

    "title": "In Over Our Heads: The Mental Demands of Modern Life",
    "content": "\nIn Over Our Heads is about the societal expectations of higher orders of consciousness that most of us do not have. \n\n\u003e All of us will spend some portion of our adult lives overmatched by the demands of modernism, the compulsory \"major\" in our culture's curriculum.\n\nThe book details Robert Kegan’s model of adult development -- basically a series of increasingly sophisticated ways one can approach ethical reasoning.\n\nGrowth is a process of 'leaving home'. It is a process of leaving the mental homes they have furnished and made familiar.\n\n## Stages of Adult Development\n### Stage 2: Self\n- the subject (self) is a collection of short-term practical interests\n- ethics in this mode is “instrumental”: aimed at satisfying your own needs, while working with or around other people’s. Relationships are “transactional”: transient alliances for mutual benefit.\n### Stage 3: Communal\n- no longer a collection of interests but you *have* interests\n- you are *in* relationships and find yourself defined by them\n- the other’s point of view matters to us intrinsically, not just extrinsically as a means of satisfying our more egocentric purposes -- one gains the ability to put oneself in the other person's shoes\n- stage 3’s limitation is that it cannot resolve conflicts between responsibilities to different relationships. If one person wants you to do something, and another person wants you to do something different, there is no good basis for decision\n- it’s impossible to base a large-scale society on the communal mode, because it’s so ineffective at coordinating complex group activities. (If individuals frequently fail to do their specific, agreed tasks, nothing can get done.) Modern societies are based on the systematic mode -- see [group limits](thoughts/group%20limits.md) and [social contracts](thoughts/social%20contracts.md)\n### Stage 4: Systematic\n- you no longer are in relationships that define you; you have relationships\n- you are “self-authored”: you choose your own principles, projects, and commitments\n- it means seeing the other person for who they really are. Emotions are just something people have, from time to time. Those need to be dealt with, but should not be taken too seriously. Relating to the other person’s principles, projects, and commitments means supporting what they most care about in the longer run\n### Stage 5: Fluid\n- systems are relativized. They move from subject to object, and are subordinated to, and organized by, the process of meaning-making itself\n- you are no longer defined as a system of principles, projects, and commitments. You have several such systems, “multiple selves,” none of them entirely coherent, and which have different values—and this is no longer a problem, because you respect all of them\n- there is sometimes an uncomfortable middle between systematic (stage 4) and fluid (stage 5) stages often referred to as stage 4.5 where nihilism and postmodernism commonly emerges. Understanding that there is no ultimate meaning, one comes to the wrong conclusion that there are no meanings at all\n- sees systems as nebulous (intangible, interpenetrating, transient, amorphous, and ambiguous) and patterned (reliable, distinct, enduring, clear, and definite)\n\n## Independence and [love](thoughts/friendship.md)\n- To want to find the answer for oneself is not to reject the advice of others\n\t- \"is not just rejecting the assumptions of her husband or church or culture; she is rejecting her *relationship* to these assumptions as truths\"\n\t- the discovery here is not that one may have different ideas, values, or beliefs but rather ideas, values, and beliefs are by their very nature assumptive\n- What brings two people together in the first place?\n\t- \"we find each other in love out of some correspondence we feel with our deepest personal and primordial themes of longing, hoping, and desiring.\"\n\t- \"these deeply felt desires and needs animate our personal images, themes, stories, and myths.

You look out the window and it's just your friendly neighbourhood mailman. So what do you do? You aren't going to shoot your dog dead. He's a pain but you wouldn't think of it. Your dog loves you. He barks to warn you when *anyone* approaches. He wants nothing bad to happen to you. That's just how he is. Problem is, he's completely indiscriminate. He thinks everyone's a danger, barks at anyone who approaches... You're *going to have a look for yourself*. You're going to bend over and stroke your dog. 'Down boy,' you say. 'It's just the postman. No harm here, silly guy'\"\n\t- This is very much a metaphor for many familial relationships (especially in Asian-Canadian/Asian-American families) in which family is incredibly overprotective of their children, despite the pleas of the children to have their own independence and to not be constantly told of what to do (I am guilty of this as well)\n\t- Here it is noteworthy that suggested way of navigating this relationship is one that puts you the *relation* between you and the parents as an object rather than the subject -- to realize that you no longer are in relationships that define you; you *have* relationships (A stage 3 to stage 4 development)\n\n## [Burnout](thoughts/burnout.md)\nMaslach describes the \"burnout prone individual\" as one who mostly yield to the other without adapting to their own capacity: \"is often unable to exert control over a situation and will passively yield to its demands rather than actively limiting them to his capacity to give... faced with self-doubt this person tries to establish a sense of self-worth by winning the approval and acceptance of other people\"\n\nThis is a very fourth-order consciousness of viewing burnout when in fact most people are not even fourth-order (majority is third-order!)\n\nCulture-as-school: the poor school (our society) whose favourite students are the ones it does not have to teach\n- this sort of psychological assimilation amounts to a process by which difference and diversity are systematically removed\n\n## [Constructivism](thoughts/constructionist.md)\nOur capacity to select, regulate, act upon, and make decisions about raw data\n\n- We select in, but we also select out. Having an active way of hearing also meant that we were deaf to other perfectly \"good\" sound in the room. We just didn't hear it. For us it wasn't happening.\n- Having put our world together, are we awake to the fact that it is an *invented* reality? Do we tend to take our construction of reality as Reality, as the fact of \"how it is out there?\"\n\n## On [the Self](thoughts/the%20Self.md) and being whole\n\n\u003e Wholesomeness not in the aesthetic sense but as in the wholeness of the self\n\nWhen American POWs from the Vietnam era were first released, nearly all performed the same two first acts after being flown to Wiesbaden, Germany: they took showers and called loved ones.\n\nInterestingly, the men were far more likely to shower first and then to call loved ones. The women were more likely to call loved ones first and then to shower.\n\nThe difference is not necessarily that the men are more selfish and care more about their own bodily comfort than about their loved ones -- in fact, they could have well thought what was most important was to talk to their loved ones but couldn't do that in a 'self' that doesn't feel cleansed or psychologically restored.\n\nThe difference is not between \"selfish\" and \"altruistic\" -- both groups may have been doing first what they needed to do to restore the self -- in that sense, could be said to be \"[selfish](thoughts/selfish.md)\". **The difference is in how the self is made whole.** For some, the self is restored by itself and is not until then capable or fit for precious connection. For others, the self is restored in and through connection.\n\n## On therapy\n- Many times the efforts in individual therapy to convert a client's stance toward the past or present story of their life from one of helpless victim to creative agent not only fails but can cause them to feel unhappier still\n- The implicit message in such reconstructions is that \"you are responsible for your life\"\n- If the client already constructs the world at the fourth order, they will more likely hear this as a confirmation of their personal authority\n\t- A reminder that while the things that others do to me or that happen to me may not be in my control, the meaning I make of them can be\n\t- A reminder that while I cannot change the wind, I can change my sails\n\t- This is a confirmation of my own power\n- If the client constructs the world at the third order however, they are likely to hear the same message as a declaration of my blameworthiness\n\t- \"You are responsible for your own life\" is then less an inspiring rallying call to self-authorship than a humiliating and dispiriting judgement that I have only myself to blame for the fix I am in\n- This is the essence of \"In Over Our Heads\" -- that the systems that we are expected to function in expect much higher orders of consciousness that the vast majority of us have attained\n- Relevant: Kierkegaard on [teaching](thoughts/teaching.md) -- \"instruction begins when you put yourself in his place so that you understand what he understands and in the way he understands it\"\n\t- Trying to teach someone who is has a third order consciousness assuming they have fourth order is like trying to explain a three-dimensional sphere to a Flatlander: it neither sees a sphere nor has any sense that there is more than what it sees -- namely, a two-dimensional circle, that piece of a sphere its plane runs through.\n\t- The one being taught will only recognize the fourth order teachings in third order structures.",

These are people who are attending some of the top schools in the world, working on some of the hardest problems that our society is working on, and have just such wealth of knowledge and kindness that I could hardly fathom why they would be interested in my circle.

    "content": "\n## Frank Jackson's Knowledge Argument[^1]\n- Mary is confined to a black-and-white room, is educated through black-and-white books and through lectures relayed on black-and-white TV. Through this, she learns everything there is to know about the physical nature of the world, including all there is to know about the causal and relational facts consequent upon all this, including of course functional roles.\n- If physicalism is true, she knows all there is to know.\n- Yet, if Mary is let out of her black-and-white room or given a colour TV, she will learn what it is like to see something red.\n\nThe implication here is that Mary cannot learn what it is like to subjectively experience red from reading physical facts (similar argument re: [semantics](thoughts/semantics.md) in [Chinese room argument](thoughts/Chinese%20room%20argument.md)).\n\n## Dennett's Refutation of the Knowledge Argument[^1]\n\n\u003e “And so, one day, Mary’s captors decided it was time for her to see colours. As a trick, they prepared a bright blue banana to present as her first colour experience ever. Mary took one look at it and said ‘Hey! You tried to trick me! Bananas are yellow but this one is blue!’ Her captors were dumbfounded. How did she do it? ‘Simple,’ she replied. ‘You have to remember that I know everything—absolutely everything— that could ever be known about the physical causes and effects of colour vision.\n\n- No double transduction\n\t- Transduction is a conversion of one for another\n\t- Peripheral/internal transducers are sense organs (e.g. eyes) that transform physically detectable properties to electrochemical signals\n\t- There is no further conversion of neural signals into a qualitative medium\n- No Cartesian theatre in the brain\n\t- There is no central place where all things 'come together' and [consciousness](thoughts/consciousness.md) happens\n\t- Point of view of the observer is smeared over a large volumen of the brain with different networks (distributed model of representation)\n- Consciousness is like fame\n\t- “Just as becoming famous is not a precisely datable event like being transduced into a medium (like being televised), so achieving consciousness in the brain is not a precisely datable transition in the brain.\n- No qualia if intrinsic properties are *instantiated by* rather than *represented by* neural activity\n\n## Essay\n\u003e Critically evaluate Frank Jackson’s “Knowledge Argument.” Does Mary learn something new, and if so, what exactly does she learn and what are the implications for physicalism? If she does not learn anything new, explain how and why this is the case.\n\nIn this paper, I posit that Frank Jackson's \"Knowledge Argument\" is *logically sound* but hinges on many bold and often presumptuous premises to be true. As such, the conclusion should not be taken for granted without more clarifications around premises and terminology.\n\nI propose that Mary has all of the 'know-that' knowledge but none of 'know-how' knowledge. The act of Mary 'seeing' colour for the first time means that she learns new 'know-how' knowledge which she did not have. Physicalism, as a result, is preserved as Mary only has 'know-that' knowledge so does not know all physical *facts* about colour perception.\n\nThis relies on three facts:\n1. There is a distinction between physical fact and physical knowledge\n1. There are unknowable physical facts that give rise to new experiences\n2. Know-how cannot be learned through know-that (e.g. reading and watching videos)\n\nBriefly, the conclusion that Frank Jackson posits is as follows:\n\n1. It is possible for someone to know all *physical* information there is to know about $x$, still *experiencing* the act of seeing colour will teach her something about $x$.\n2. Certain experiences (e.g. experiencing colour) still teach Mary something new. Then, this means that all physical information there is to know about $x$ do not completely describe *all* information about $x$.\n3. This contradicts the theory of physicalism: that everything, including mental states, has a physical explanation. Extending this argument: if we could know every physical detail about someone else's brain, one would still not understand what it is like to experience things for them (Nagel's Bat Argument).\n\nHowever, this conclusion relies heavily on the first premise being true, that is, it being possible for one to \"acquire ... all the physical information there is to obtain about what goes on when we see [$x$]\". Let us first examine the explicit distinction between 'physical knowledge' and 'physical facts' here.\n\nKnowledge, specifically, entails all 'knowable' things. In the context of this paper, I define 'knowledge' as justified true belief. Subject $S$ knows $x$ if and only if[^1]:\n\n1. $x$ is true\n2. $S$ believes that $x$\n3. $S$ is justified in believing that $x$.\n\nI posit that there are facts (read true statements about object $x$) that cannot be known, let alone proven. For example, let us imagine that it is a fact that aliens do not exist. As of now, we have no suitable methodology or measurements that would allow us to confirm this fact (this would involve an exhaustive search of the universe which, as far as we know, is impossible). Thus, the set of all true statements about object $x$ is equal to or larger than the set of all obtainable knowledge about $x$. To know all physical knowledge about $x$ then does not necessarily imply knowing all physical *facts* about something.\n\nSpecifically, we note that the original Mary's Room argument phrases knowing as knowing \"all the physical information *there is to obtain* about what goes on when we see [$x$]\" (emphasis added). Then, there may be some physical facts Mary may not know that contribute to her experience of experiencing 'yellowness' when seeing a banana for the first time that she may not have known ahead of time, despite her having complete physical knowledge of the banana. As a result, Mary *experiences* something new (namely, seeing yellow) but does not learn anything new.\n\n---\n\nThe sharp-eyed may note that the previous argument relies on the fact that the set of all true statements about object $x$ is explicitly larger than the set of all obtainable knowledge about $x$. However, the statement originally assumed that the set of all true statements is *larger than or equal to* the set of all obtainable knowledge. This exposes an edge case which could be problematic where the set of all true statements is *exactly equal to* the set of all obtainable knowledge (i.e. subject $S$ knows all obtainable knowledge about $x$, which coincidentally is also the set of all true statements about $x$).\n\nI will show how this does not prove to be a problem for our argument. I raise one main question: Why is it obvious that she will learn something new about the world through an experience?\n\nTo be explicit, let us examine the framing of the Mary's room[^2]:\n\n- An epistemic subject _A_ appears to have no access to particular items of knowledge about a subject _B_\n- _A_ cannot know that _B_ has an experience of a particular quality _Q_ on certain occasions\n- This particular item of knowledge about _B_ is inaccessible to _A_ _because_ _A_ never had experiences of _Q_ herself\n\nThis is quite similar to Thomas Nagel's Bat Argument[^3]. Despite everything that Mary knows about seeing colour, she doesn't know what it is like to *see* colour.\n\nSpecifically, the Knowledge Argument relies on knowledge that is explicit or codified and can be communicated via language. I argue that, conceptually, one cannot 'know' all there is to know about seeing colour through purely linguistically communicated language. I refer to this 'linguistically unknowable' knowledge as tacit knowledge.\n\nWe first examine three different kinds of knowledge[^4]:\n\n1. Acquaintance knowledge: we get to know the characters of others (like friends) by being around them. This is a form of tacit knowledge.\n2. Knowledge-that: propositional knowledge, facts about the world obtained through reading, talking, and consuming content. This can be linguistically communicated.\n3. Knowledge-how: truly knowing how to do something, speaking, reading, etc. This is a form of tacit knowledge.\n\nMy position is that knowledge-how *cannot* be learned through only knowledge-that. Ryle calls this the Sufficiency Argument: \"how could propositional knowledge be sufficient for knowing how to do something?\"[^5]\n\nFrom this list above, knowledge-that is the only form of transferrable or communicable knowledge. Knowledge-how is a form of tacit knowledge which is inexpressible via language. Knowledge-how, by definition, is only acquired through practical experience in the relevant context. To attempt to reconstruct knowledge-how using knowledge-that is to build a [potemkin village](thoughts/potemkin%20village.md), a sort of 'facade' of understanding. One can read all about playing a piano -- the music theory, the muscles to actuate, the feel of the keys -- yet fail to actually play the piano. Learning to play piano requires an embodied experience of feeling the keys and wiring the feedback between the concept of music in your brain to the motion of playing the notes.\n\nThus, in Frank Jackson's Knowledge Argument, Mary has all the 'know-that' knowledge about the perception of colour but none of 'know-how' knowledge. The argument depends heavily on Physicalism stating that Mary knows all physical facts about any given object. I have shown through this paper that the premises of Jackson's argument is dubious at best, namely the ability for Mary to know all *physical* facts about $x$. Thus, Physicalism is preserved.\n\n[^1]: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/knowledge-analysis/\n[^2]: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia-knowledge/#BasiIdea\n[^3]: https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/iatl/study/ugmodules/humananimalstudies/lectures/32/nagel_bat.pdf\n[^4]: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/knowledge-how/#LingArgu\n[^5]: *Knowing How and Knowing That: The Presidential Address*, Ryle 1946\n[^6]: This content is sourced from Professor [Evan Thompson](https://evanthompson.me/)'s course materials for PHIL451A at UBC.

    "title": "The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software",
    "content": "\nFull post: [A case for funding Open Source](posts/paid-open-source.md)\n\n## Quotes\n### [Maintenance](thoughts/creation%20vs%20maintenance.md)\nA lot of initiatives like HacktoberFest are widely championed as 'good for open source' yet frequently cause maintainers to seize up with anxiety because such initiatives often attract low-quality contributors looking to snag a free t-shirt. \"Open source code is public, but it doesn't have to be participatory: maintainers can buckle under excess demand for their [attention](thoughts/attention%20economy.md)\"\n\nThis is akin to a writer being asked to edit and make changes to the same book every day, into perpetuity, long after they’ve reaped the initial financial and reputational rewards from its creation. What's more, unlike other content, open source code is relied upon by people, companies, and other institutions that need it to keep working, long after the maintainer's interest may have waned.\n\nWhen Richard Stallman first described free software as \"free as in speech, not free as in beer,\" the distinction he wished to make is that the term \"free\" referred to what one could do with the software, rather than to its price.\n\nThe common misconception of software is that it is often characterized as \"zero marginal cost,\" meaning that it can be distributed for nearly nothing, regardless of how many additional people consume it. The problem is not that simple. Code is nearly free to distribute, but maintenace can still be expensive. External contributions don't necessarily reduce the burden of maintenance either, because they still require someone to review and merge them.\n\nThe work of an open source developer goes beyond the initial costs of creation. Maybe developers can't help but make things, and share the things they make, but every time they do, and ever time they find success, a tiny, invisible clock begins to tick, and they're tasked with managing the care and feeding of their code into perpetuity.\n\n### Dependencies and [Infrastructure](thoughts/infrastructure.md)\nThere's even a term called the *bus factor*, where project health is a measured by the number of developers that would need to get hit by a bus before the project is in trouble.\n\nHowever, this 'theory' no longer matches up with empirical observation. In fact, less than 5% of developers were responsible for over 95% of code and social interactions on GitHub. The average software developer these days easily relies on hundreds of open source projects to write code these days, it's inevitable that they'll only be able to passively consume most of them.\n\nInfrastructure is recursively defined by public consensus. It's the set of structures that we've collectively decided are most valuable *in any given moment,* and, therefore, its boundaries and definitions are expected to change over time.\n\nLike a bridge that needs to support more traffic that it was built for, every social platform is scramlbing to upgrade its infrastructure to accommodate the volume of social interactions we're dealing with today. Platforms need to build skyscrapers where there were once villages.\n\n### Identity\nLike joining a club, it's not about how many times you've attending meetings but how you self-identify, and how others identify you, that makes you a 'member'. Some attendees might come every week for years and still not be considered part of the group.\n\n### Code as Content\nCode, like any other type of content available online today, is **trending toward modularity**: a mille-feuille layer cake of little libraries instead of one big, jiggling, Jell-O mold.\n\n\"Like a book or video, code is just a bunch of information, packaged up for distribution. But its role as a utility is more explicit.\"\n\nToday, \"content\" is better understood not as a thing we set out to make -- as an automaker might exist solely to produce cars -- but as \"an externality from [our] existing social systems.\" Content is a snapshot of our civilization.\n\n### Platforms and Governance\nA \"Benevolent Dictator for Life\" or BDFL for short, describes authors of open source projects who retain control even as the project grows. A great example of this is Linus Torvalds, who even after 14,000 unique contributors to the Linux kernel, still is the only person allowed to merge contributions into the main branch.\n\n\"Like a talent agency, platforms add value to creators by first improving their *distribution*, exposing them to potentially millions of people. ... This [feedback loop](thoughts/feedback%20loops.md) is [positive sum](thoughts/positive%20sum.md), encouraging more creators to join. So long as more people keep using the platform, there's no sense that any one creator will ever suck up all the oxygen in the room.\"\n\n###  Commons-based Peer Production\nThe economist Elinor Ostrom identified 8 design principles that contribute to a well-managed, succesful commons:\n1. Membership boundaries are clearly defined\n2. The rules that govern the commons should match the actual conditions\n3. Those who are affected by these rules can participate in modifying them\n4. Those who monitor the rules are either community members or are accountable to the community, rather than outsiders\n5. Those who violate the rules are subject to *graduated sanctions*, which vary depending on the seriousness and context of the offense\n6. Conflicts should be resolved within the community, using low-cost methods\n7. External authorities recognize the right of community members to devise their own institutions\n8. If the commons is part of a larger system, its governing rules are organized into multiple 'nested' layers of authority\n\n\"At a company, only employees can do the work, limited by their job function. But in a commons, anyone can stumble upon an advertised task and volunteer themselves. By removing 'property and contract', the commons will theoretically select for the best person for the job at a lower cost.\"\n\nMain types of goods\n\n||Excludable|Non-excludable|\n|---|---|---|\n|Rivalrous|Private Goods (e.g. cars, domain names)|Commons (e.g. forests, online privacy)|\n|Non-rivalrous|Club Goods (e.g. cable, subscriptions like Netflix or Spotify)|Public Goods (e.g. air, open source code)|\n\nNon-rivalry: If I download code from GitHub, my decision doesn't diminish your ability to download that same code. (By contrast, if I bite into an apple and hand it to you, there is now less apple for you to eat) -- a key point here is that open source software isn't necessarily non-rivalrous especially when it comes to marginal increase in maintenance for each additional user\nNon-excludability: If someone owns my copy of my code, it is difficult for me to prevent them from sharing it with others. (By contrast, if I build a theme park, I can prevent people from entering by putting up a turnstile or charging admission)\n\nThe implication is that support can be handled in a fully decentralized manner that will distribute its costs among users -- but someone still needs to review, manage, and process these reports. This maintenance cost is referred to as the \"servicing costs\" of software, noting the \"asymmetry between the low cost of community participation and the high cost that others' participation places on the leaders of the community.\" She compares the problem to traffic congestion, where each person wants to drive their own car, but in doing so increases the congestion experienced by others, and, eventually, themself.\n\n### [Incentive](thoughts/incentives.md) Structures\n\u003e \"Creation is an intrinsic motivator, maintenance usually requires extrinsic motivation\" -- @balupton\n\nIf production runs on intrinsic motivation, money is an *extrinsic motivator* that is thought to interfere with an already well-coordinated system. Although the commons might not be as *profitable* as the firm, it's also more resilient, because the currency of its transactions is the desire to participate, rather than money.\n\n\u003e External, expected rewards diminish the intrinsic motivation of the fundraising open-source contributor. It risks transporting a community of peers into a transactional terminal. And that buyer-seller frame detracts from the magic that is peer-collaborators.\n\n\"Whereas active contributors show interest in adding value to others early on, casual contributors demonstrate an acute, personal need at the outset.\"\n\nThere are two types of funders that care enough to spend money on open source:\n1. Institutions: usually companies, but also governments and universities. They spend money to influence and access a project they care about -- especially gaining priority for issues and pull requests that concern them. They can also pay to gain brand influence through the open source project\n2. Individuals: usually developers who are direct users. Politicians who fund their campaigns from grassroots donations are generally viewed more favorably by the public than are those who are funded by corporate donations. I'm not sure that open source is so different.\n\n### Projects and Production Models\nSimilar to governance models in [governance](thoughts/governance.md)\n\n\"While some open source developers write code in public from the very beginning, many prefer to do their initial creative work in private, so they can properly articulate their ideas before opening the project up for feedback. Even if developers do publish their code early on, they may not advertise it widely until they have something ready for release.\"\n\nBased off of arelationship between contributors and users, we can think of projects in terms of their contributor growth and user growth.\n\n||High user growth|Low User Growth|\n|---|---|---|\n|High contributor growth| Federations (e.g. Rust) | Clubs (e.g. Astropy) |\n|Low contributor growth| Stadiums (e.g. Babel) | Toys (e.g. ssh-chat) |\n\n- Federations: 'bazaars', the epitome of open source projects. Small percentage of overall # of projects. Complex to manage (typically develop [decentralized](thoughts/decentralization.md) governance structures)\n- Clubs: roughly overlapping group of contributors and users. May not have huge reach, but loved and built by a group of enthusiasts.\n- Stadiums: powered by a few main contributors, generally widely-depended upon packages. Centralized structure.\n- Toys: effectively personal projects\n\nJonathan Zdziarski (aka @NerveGas) on user demands: \"There is definitely a place for users and. their demands, however that's not inside the community (unless they're also contributing devs); the community, as in practicing any art form, is vulnerable; you wouldn't sit and criticize a painter while they're still painting their piece. The user base needs to be moved outside of the artistic realm and into the museum, where you software is on display.\"",

He believed that learning to program was analogous to learning to write, providing children with new ways of organizing and expressing their ideas.\"\n\nDoes language matter when programming?\n\"A programming language is like a natural, human language in that it favors certain metaphors, images, and ways of thinking. The language used strongly colors the computer culture\" ([linguistic relativism](thoughts/linguistic%20relativism.md))\n\n### Microworlds and simplification\nNewton \"understood\" the universe by reducing whole planets to points that move according to a fixed set of laws of motion. Is this grasping the essence of the real world or hiding its complexities?\n\nrestricted microworlds give students the freedom to explore, without needing to ask for permission or reassurance from teachers\n\nIn school, false theories are no longer tolerated. Our educational system rejects the \"false theories\" of children, thereby rejecting the way children really learn.\n\nDanger of 'simplicity': [Design Justice](thoughts/Design%20Justice.md)\n\"Imagine a suggestion that we invent a special language to help children learn to speak. This language would have a small vocabulary of just fifty words, but fifty words so well chosen that all ideas could be expressed using them. Would this language be easier to learn? Perhaps the vocabulary might be easy to learn, but the use of the vocabulary to express what one wanted to say would be so contorted that only the most motivated and brilliant children would learn to say more than 'hi'.\"\n\n### On mechanical thinking\nDiscovery cannot be a setup; invention cannot be scheduled\n\nPeople often fear that using computer models for people will lead to mechanical or linear thinking: They worry about people losing respect for their intuitions, sense of values, powers of judgement. They worry about instrumental reason becoming a model for good thinking. I take these fears seriously but do not see them as fears about computers themselves but rather as fears about hwo culture will assimilate the computer presence.\n\nRelevant to [AI systems](/posts/ai-systems)\nThe definition of artificial intelligence can be narrow or broad. In the narrow sense, AI is concerned with extending the capacity of machines to perform functions that would be considered intelligent if performed by people. Its goal is to construct machines, and, in doing so, it can be thought of as a branch of advanced engineering... In order to make a machine capable of learning, we have to probe deeply into the nature of learning. And from this kind of research comes the broader definition of artificial intelligence: that of cognitive science.\n\n\"The question to ask about the program is not whether it is right of wrong, but if it is fixable. If this way of looking at intellectual products were generalized to how the larger culture thinks about knowledge and its acquisition, we all might be less intimidated by our fears of 'being wrong.'\"\n\n### [Multiple realization](thoughts/multiple%20realization.md)\nMen have always been interested in flying. Once upon a time, scientists determined to understand how birds fly. First they watched them, hoping to correlate the motion of a bird's wings with its upward movement. Then they proceeded to experiment and found that when its feathers were plucked, a bird could no longer fly. Having thus determined that feathers were the organ of flight, the scientists then focused their efforts on microscopic and ultramicroscopic investigation of feathers in order to discover the nature of their flight-giving power.\n\n\"You have no reason to suppose that airplanes and birds work the same way -- birds have no propellors, airplanes have no feathers\"\n\n\"If we had to base our opinions on observation of how poorly children learned French in American schools, we would have to conclude that most people were incapable of mastering it. But we know that all normal children would learn it easily if they lived in France.\"\n\nIn retrospect, we know that the road that led from nineteenth-century transportation was quite different. The invention of the automobile and the airplane did not come from a detailed study of how their predecessors, such as horse-drawn carriages, worked or did not work.\n\n### Logical consistency in systems\nThe conflicts are regulated and kept in check rather than \"resolved\" through the intervention of special agents no less simple-minded than the original ones. Their way of reconciling differences does not involve forcing the system into a logically consistent mold.\n\nOn brain being compartmentalized\nWe put our skills and heuristic strategies into a kind of tool box -- and while their interaction can, in the course of time, give rise to global changes, the act of learning is itself a *local* event.\n\n### Knowledge distillation\nOn the role of [knowledge distillers](thoughts/knowledge%20distillation.md) and [teaching](thoughts/teaching.md): \nThis problem goes deeper than a mere short supply of such people. The fact that in the past there was no role for such people has been cast into social and institutional concrete; now there is a role but there is no place for them.\n\nIt is a step toward a situation in which the line between learners and teachers can fade\n\nA stage of unconscious work, which might appear to the mathematician as temporarily abandoning the task or leaving the problem to incubate, has to intervene... On the contrary, the problem has been turned over to a very active unconscious which relentlessly begins to combine the elements supplied to it by the \n\n### Misc\nOn self-correcting systems like bikes\n\"Thus learning to ride does not mean learning to balance, it means learning not to unbalance, learning not to interfere\"\n\nPart of the fun is sharing, posting graphics on the walls, modifying and experimenting with each other's work, and bringing the \"new\" products back to the original inventors.\n\nOn rejecting the false dichotomy of verbalizable versus nonverbalizable knowledge\n\"No knowledge is entirely reducible to words, and no knowledge is entirely ineffable\"\n\n\"As knowing how to use a computer becomes increasingly necessary to effective social and economic participation, the position of the underprivileged could worsen, and the computer could exacerbate existing class distinctions.\"\n\nOn the split between 'humanities' and 'science'\n\"It is self-perpetuating: The more the culture is divided, the more each side builds separation into its new growth\"\n\nThe printed page cannot capture either the product or the process: the serendipitous discoveries, the bugs, and the mathematical insights all require movement to be appreciated.",

    "content": "\nWhat is the role of moderation in [communities](thoughts/communities.md)? What does good/bad moderation look like? (posts/comments/membership)\n\nI think a key part of answering this is trying to define what role a community occupies. Is it just a collection of people gathering around a shared identity? Or is it supposed to be a platform for moderated idea discussion/generation? Or something else in between.\n\nThinking about this at the [infrastructure](/thoughts/infrastructure) level too, if a community's purpose is to serve as infrastructure so that it enables conversations, should infrastructure be regulated/enforced or something that should just play out naturally?\n\nBroadly defined, I see moderation as having two main categories: moderation of users and moderation of content. Moderation then, is to ensure that the set of values that is being conveyed by the users/content roughly aligns with that of the group/community.\n\nModeration of users involves regulating the *membership* of individuals within the community whereas moderation of content regulates what can/can't be said in the community.\n\nModeration gets problematic when it is used to target and discriminate against individuals because of personal relations or vendettas. I was thinking about also saying it becomes problematic when it discriminates against characteristics but I'm hesitant on this bit. Is it categorically different to exclude people who are misogynistic vs those of a certain race? Probably yes but I don't have a solid argument for it yet.\n",

More devices than [IP addresses](thoughts/IP%20Addresses.md)! What do we do?\n2. Home router gets assigned an IP (public IP) by the ISP\n3. Devices connected on the local network are assigned a private IP address (usually starts with subnet mask 196.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x)\n4.

Entries are removed when a conversation is coming to a close (stream based protocol, detect termination packets)\n6. Does the inverse when it receives a packet\n\n![](thoughts/images/NAT.jpeg)\n\n## Hole-punching\n\u003e Hole punching (or sometimes punch-through) is a technique in computer networking for establishing a direct connection between two parties in which one or both are behind firewalls or behind routers that use network address translation (NAT).\n\nMostly used in [decentralized](thoughts/decentralization.md) or [peer-to-peer](thoughts/peer-to-peer.md) communication as the latency incurred by relaying through a central server is prohibitively expensive for real-time activity like voice calling, file syncing, etc.\n\nHole-punching usually involves the use of third-party hosts that run STUN or ICE to figure out the public address of the NAT. \n\nThe idea is that to allow packets to come in from a remote endpoint, the computer behind the NAT or firewall needs to send something to the remote endpoint first. By doing so it creates a “hole” in the NAT or firewall through which communications can proceed. This even works when both sides are behind a NAT/firewall, when both sides start by punching a hole in their respective NAT/firewalls.\n\nTypes of NAT/Firewall combinations\n1. Endpoint-Independent Mapping (EIM): all outgoing connections from the same IP address and port have the same modified IP address and port\n2. Address-Dependent Mapping (ADM): each outgoing connection to a different address from the same IP address and port has a different modified IP address and port\n3. Address and Port-Dependent Mapping (APDM): same as ADM, instead of just address, it's address + port\n4. Endpoint-Independent Filtering (EIF): all packets from remote addresses are allowed for a single endpoint on the NAT/Firewall\n5. Address-Dependent Filtering (ADF): only allows packets to a specific endpoint from a specific address if a computer behind the NAT/Firewall has sent a packet to that address\n6. Address and Port-Dependent Filtering (APDF): same as ADF but instead of just address, it's address + port\n\n### Efficacy\nFrom [*UDP NAT and Firewall Puncturing in the Wild* by Gertjan Halkes and Johan Pouwelse](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-642-20798-3_1.pdf)\n\n- Over 79% of peers on the Internet are not directly connectable\n\t- Using a simple redez-vouz mechanism decreases this to ~15% of peers\n\t- Keep-alive messages should be sent at least every 55 seconds to ensure that mappings/holes will remain open on almost every NAT/firewall\n- Firewalls and NAT makes establishing P2P connections directly between any two machines hard\n\t- Firewalls are frequently configured to allow only outgoing connections, based on the assumption of the client-server model of communication\n\t- NAT hides the 'true' port and IP combination of any machine that is behind it, meaning that connecting to an arbitrary port is often not allowed\n- Mostly useful for UDP traffic as setting up a connecting for TCP when NAT/firewall requires unusual or non-standard use of TCP and IP mechanisms, and may rely on specific NAT/firewall behaviour to work \n- Detection\n\t- NAT\n\t\t- A and B report the remote address and port they see when a connection is set up. They now know their own external address and port\n\t\t- If all other peers agree on peer A's remote address and port, peer A determines they have no NAT or the NAT has EIM behaviour\n\t\t- If peer A's remote address and port are reported differ among peers, peer A determines they are behind a A(P)DM NAT\n\t- Filtering Behaviour\n\t\t- Check order of requests received when connecting to a rendez-vous server\n\t\t\t- Side note: this many not always be true. The reason for this is that the direct connection request is not always faster than the reverse connection request which is sent through the rendez-vous peer. This is known as a Triangle Inequality Violation (TIV)\n\t\t\t- This can happen as often as 40% of the time although lower numbers are more common\n\t\t- When a peer A tries to set up a connection using rendezvous R, it will always first send a direct connection request to the remote peer B\n\t\t\t- If the direct connection request from A to B arrives first, there is no filtering behaviour or it uses EIF\n\t\t\t- If the rendez-vouz connection request from R to B arrives first, the filtering behaviour is most likely A(P)DF\n\n![[thoughts/images/NAT-firewall-share.png]]\n\n![[thoughts/images/NAT-firewall-connection-rates.png]]\n\nPossible explanations for a non-100% connection rate even in EIM-EIF to EIM-EIF peers\n- UDP packets being dropped under high UDP packet load (especially in consumer-grade NAT/firewalls)\n- Routers stop functioning when mapping tables are full (not out of the realm of possibilies, only 65535 entries)\n- Use of [CGNAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-grade_NAT) (NAT at the ISP level instead of home-router)\n\n\n### Flow\nLet $A$ and $B$ be the two hosts, each in its own private network; $N_A$ and $N_B$ are the two NAT devices with globally reachable IP addresses $EIP_A$ and $EIP_B$ respectively. $S$ is a public server with a well-known, globally reachable IP address.\n1. A and B both begin a [UDP](thoughts/UDP.md) conversation with $S$\n2. NAT devices $N_A$ and $N_B$ create UDP translations and assign temporary external ports $EP_A$ and $EP_B$\n3. S looks at UDP packets to get source ports of $N_A$ and $N_B$ (through $EP_A$ and $EP_B$)\n4. S makes pairs of external IP addresses assigned by the NAT along with temporary external ports and exchanges them between $A$ and $B$ (S passes $EIP_A:EP_A$ to $B$ and $EIP_B:EP_B$ to $A$)\n5. $A$ and $B$ send packets to each other and their appropriate NAT devices create the entries in their lookup tables\n\t1. $A$ sends a packet to $EIP_B:EP_B$.\n\t2. $N_A$ examines $A$'s outgoing packet and adds (Source-IP-$A$, $EP_A$, $EIP_B$, $EP_B$) to its translation table.\n\t3. $B$ sends a packet to $EIP_A:EP_A$.\n\t2. $N_B$ examines $B$'s outgoing packet and adds (Source-IP-$B$, $EP_B$, $EIP_A$, $EP_A$) to its translation table.\n6. Best case scenario $N_A$ and $N_B$ should have made the entry in the translation. Worst case, both NAT devices have not yet made the entry and drop the first packet sent from $B$\n7. At worst, the second packet from both $A$ and $B$ make it to each other.

I can put a photograph of it in an article, write a book discussing it, even make a movie about it, without paying the Louvre anything. The Louvre has the right to hold the original physically, but every other meaningful right is in the public domain.

Our trips are short, and we travel lightly - by necessity - for we have no real way to \"bring\" anything with us from site to site besides our wallets.\n\nThe NFT, at least as a concept, represents something of a sea change in that mentality.

    "content": "\nNagel's Bat Argument (against Physicalism)\n1. Physicalism (read: [Materialism](thoughts/Materialism.md)) is the thesis that everything that exists is physical. \n2. Physical facts then, are objective truth (\"the kind that can be observed and understood from many points of view and by individuals with different perceptual systems\")\n3. Even if we knew everything about how the bat's sonar system works, we would not know what is is like for the bat to perceive using this system.\n\t1. 'What it's like': in this case, something is conscious (a bat) if and only if there is something it's like to be that being (only a bat knows what it is like for a bat to be a bat)\n\t2. One, for example, cannot imagine a chair to know what it is like for a chair to be a chair.\n\t3. For a state to be conscious is for it to have a subjective character (to seem or feel a certain way to the subject). A conscious experience is a state that is both subjective and qualitative.\n4. Therefore, complete knowledge of the physical facts about a bat's  perceptual system would not yield knowledge of certain facts about a  bat’s experiences\n\nPhysicalism leaves out the subjective facts, so it’s a mystery how it \ncould be true (give that [qualia](thoughts/qualia.md) and the subjective experience exists).\n\nRelated: Frank Jackson's [Knowledge Argument](thoughts/Knowledge%20Argument.md)\n\n## Fishes\nA famous Taoist story about happiness and knowing what it is like to be a fish\n\n- Zhuangzi and Huizi were strolling on a bridge over the River Hao, when the former observed, “See how the minnows dart between the rocks! Such is the happiness of fishes.”\n- “You not being a fish,” said Huizi, “how can you possibly know what makes fish happy?”\n- “And you not being I,” said Zhuangzi, “how can you know that I don’t know what makes fish happy?”\n- “If I, not being you, cannot know what you know,” replied Huizi, “does it not follow from that very fact that you, not being a fish, cannot know what makes fish happy?”\n- “Let us go back,” said Zhuangzi, “to your original question. You asked me how I knew what makes fish happy. The very fact you asked shows that you knew I knew—as I did know, from my own feelings on this bridge.”\n\nWhy did Zhuangzi, who wrote it down, show himself to be defeated by his logician friend?\n\n\u003e We can each understand what the other is feeling because, arguing about the fish, we are doing exactly what the fish are doing: having fun, doing something we do well for the sheer pleasure of doing it.\n\nHow can we know what it is like for others to [play](thoughts/play.md) if not that we are playing ourselves?\n\n",

    "title": "PHIL240A Final Paper",
    "content": "\n## Section I: Trusting Institutions\n\u003e Is it ever responsible to trust an institution about something that outstrips your individual ability to verify? Explain why. If you answer yes, how do you ground this trust? If you answer no, how do you deal with the fact that trusting at least some institutions is central to the success of (at least a democratic, arguably any contemporary human) society?\n\nIn answering this question, there seems to be two different answers depending on how we define trust here. We turn to Hawley's differentiation between epistemic and practical trust here (2012, p. 2031). Hawley defines epistemic trust as trust in someone as a speaker or source of knowledge and defines practical trust as trust in someone as an actor. I argue that it is irresponsible to have epistemic trust in institutions about something that outstrips one's individual ability to verify, whereas it is responsible (and in fact necessary) to be able to have practical trust in institutions about something that outstrips one's ability to verify.\n\nFirst, note that to answer this question concretely, the act of having a 'responsible attitude' (e.g. of trust) needs to be properly defined in this context. Here, I define 'responsible attitude' to mean an attitude held by an actor that is justified and which is within one's control (not coerced).\n\nI argue that it is epistemically irrational behaviour to trust an institution about something that is outside one's ability to individually verify. Looking to cases of objective knowledge (i.e. scientific knowledge), let us take for example government public health announcements. Generally, all public health announcements made by the government are scientifically supported, which means they are backed by published, peer-reviewed, and supposedly reproducible scientific work. At its core, the scientific method is about doubt. Scientific hypotheses need to be falsifiable, assumptions and priors must be stated. If some theory is unverifiable, then it is invalid as a scientific theory and would be epistemically irrational to treat the opinionated claim by the institution as if it were objective fact.\n\nFrom the perspective of religious texts, even if the institution were to be a flawless revealed source, it would still be epistemically irrational behaviour to trust the 'revealed source'. A so-called revealed source still has to be interpreted and this necessarily happens through human interactions mediated by language. As similarly claimed by Dharmakīrti, \"[Vedic] words do not [themselves] declare: 'This is our meaning, not this.' This meaning [which Vedic words have] must be postulated by humans. The latter are possessed, however, of [moral defects] like desire\" (PV 1.312-313 in Eltschinger, 2012, p. 33). This 'revealed source' then cannot be taken as a source of epistemic knowledge.\n\nHowever, proving that trusting individually unverifiable claims made by an institution is epistemically irrational doesn't rule out the possibility of *practical trust.* As the question originally asks, how do we deal with trusting *some* institutions? I turn to the notion of reliability here as a means of evaluating trust, specifically in the context of *relying on institutions as actors*.\n\nSimilar to Goldman's 5th main piece of evidence for trust, (2001, p. 93), we can look to the institutions past track-records as a good heuristic for reliability. While we may not be able to verify that some claim is 'correct' at the moment, we can show that the institution has made historically correct statements. If we treat institutions like computational black boxes that take in inputs and produce outputs, we can reuse Duran and Jongsma's notion of Computational Reliability, which states that \"researchers are justified in believing the results of AI systems because there is a reliable process that yields, most of the time, trustworthy results\" (2021, p. 332). At the core of it, the notion of reliability gets at the fact that trust exists as a means to avoid needing to re-evaluate the validity of each statement or each action. If I know that my local cafe opens at 9:30am every morning, I don't need to check what time it opens today because I *trust* that they are reliable and open at the time they claim to open.\n\nAs such, we extend the notion of *practical trust* to institutional claims that are outside our individual ability to verify given that they have been historically reliable actors. This does *not* extend to epistemic trust as this should be grounded in verifiable and falsifiable statements.\n\n## Section II: Resolving the pickle\n\u003e In the final episode of Marvel's TV series _Loki_, Loki and Sylvie have the following exchange:\n\u003e \n\u003e SYLVIE: What was I thinking trusting you? Has this whole thing been a con?\n\u003e \n\u003e LOKI: Really? That’s what you think of me… after all this time? Sure. Why not? Evil Loki’s master plan comes together. Well, you never trusted me, did you? What was the point? Can’t you see? This is bigger than our experience.\n\u003e \n\u003e SYLVIE: Why aren’t we seeing this the same way?\n\u003e \n\u003e LOKI: Because you can’t trust… and I can’t be trusted.\n\u003e \n\u003e SYLVIE: Then I guess we’re in a pickle.\n\u003e \n\u003e Your assignment is to solve the pickle. You can do this by either convincing Sylvie to trust Loki (and by extension He Who Remains), or by convincing Loki that Sylvie's right and no one (or at least no one in this room, but if not them, then who and about what?) should be trusted. Remember that both Loki and Sylvie are very smart and very attached to their respective viewpoints, so you'll have to both 1) show them that you understand their point of view (by incorporating counter-arguments to the position you're arguing in favor of), and 2) give them some new epistemic tools to understand their situation differently if you're going to be convincing.\n\n\n\u003e I am arguing that Sylvie cannot trust either of them.\n\u003e S: Sylvie; the one who can't trust\n\u003e L: Loki; the one who can't be trusted\n\nL: Sylvie, look. We should be looking at multiple different perspectives on epistemic trust and reliability here. It's clear that we can't go off of our gut feelings about trust here.\n\nS: You're just trying to stall for time, we don't have much time left!\n\nL: Calm down. Just babbling back and forth like this will get us nowhere. Throwing something from one epistemic culture that’s disjoint from another epistemic culture cannot lead to reconciliation without a shared epistemic culture. We need to arrive at a basic shared epistemic culture (Smith and Vaidya, 2022, 8:43)\n\nS: But don't you see? That's the main problem! We don't *have* any shared epistemic grounds. We may be the same person from different timelines but our experiences have been completely different. I've been hunted by the TVA since I was a child. My parents told me I was adopted at an early age. I have known no true home.\n\nL: But why can't you just default to trusting? Why can't you hold trust as an unquestioning attitude? If you questioned everything and deliberated everything all the time, you wouldn't be able to function at all in this world! (Nguyen 2019, pp. 22-23)\n\nS: First off, I just told you why I can't trust. You give me no additional reason to trust you! Actually, quite the opposite. All you've done is trick people! There is no ground on which to even stand on. \"The everyday, taken-for-granted reality of civilian life ignores much; civility assumes the nonlethal intentions of others. In war, however, all such assumptions evaporate: one cannot trust the ground one walks on, the air one breathes, nor can one expect with full assuredness that tomorrow will come again\" (Kearl 1989, 353, as cited in Nguyen 2019, p. 9). We are in a war right now, Loki.\n\nL: What happened to our friendship? We had a thing going! Shouldn't you be partial towards your friends? Stroud (2006) and Kelly (2004) argue that we _should_ have partiality towards friends not only in actions but beliefs as well, though this isn’t always the right thing to do. As Stroud says, ‘friendship requires epistemic irrationality’ (Stroud 2006, Kelly 2004, as cited in Hawley, p. 2032). You see, I'm a partialist. I believe that someone who fails to be doxastically partial to me would fail to be a good friend to me (Crawford 2017, p. 1576).\n\nS: Bold assumption of you to make. Are we even friends? Do you think you can play tricks on me that easily? Besides, I am against doxastic partiality for friends anyways. I mean, we can be partial to our friends but not because it is normative to be always partial to our friends. We can be partial to friends but they can also be wrong given state-given reasons. The state-given reason here is that you are only trusting He Who Remains because he promises something you've wanted for a long time: the throne. By definition, a reason for an attitude is state-given when its status as a reason is grounded in some relation it bears to a property of having that attitude in one’s circumstances (Crawford 2017, p. 1587). Clearly, you are 'believing' He Who Remains only because it can benefit you immensely. \n\nL: Fine! If you can't trust me, can you trust He Who Remains? He knows all, he's omniscient. He's like a god of gods! He has seen all potential timelines and he knows what is the best move to make here.\n\nS: How can we trust he who remains? Nothing he claims is anything we can verify ourselves. All so-called 'revealed sources' still needs to be interpreted and this necessarily happens through human interactions mediated by language. We are both listening to him are we not? Yet, we are interpreting this two very different ways. There's no way to determine who's right about claims transcending human knowledge (Eltschinger 2012, pp. 33-34).\n\nL: Look, I get that you don't trust me. But you can trust one thing: \"I love to be right\" (Episode 2).  Objectively, let's look at how to ensure it’s possible to accurately evaluate whether or not someone is an epistemic authority, hm? Just look at it mathematically. Think about what’s at stake and think about what the tolerance threshold is that we can have in the relevant domain (Smith and Vaidya, 1:01:48). Think about the consequences here! If we make the wrong move, we could end the entire multiverse. We don't have a lot of time.\n\nS: I'm not convinced. Look, we tried establishing a shared epistemic baseline; it didn't work. I can't trust *anyone* in this room. Loki, I can't trust you: you've lied to everyone in your life up until this point. How can I be sure you're not just lying to get your way? You're on the brink of getting everything you've ever wished for. He Who Remains, I can't trust you either. I've hated the TVA my whole life and now the guy who runs the whole thing is telling me I have a chance to just kill him and end it all? Of course I'm going to choose to kill you.\n\nL: W-wait. Think of the consequences! How could you trust *anyone* then?\n\nS: I... can't. Other people can trust because they've needed to for social reasons. Trust encourages them to rely on each other for mutual good (Nguyen, p. 2). But I haven't had any of that -- I've never needed to. I've never had a family to depend on. Until I have some semblance of reliability and consistency in my life, that just won't be possible.\n\n[Sylvie sends Loki through a time window and kills He Who Remains]",

Certain configurations of physical phenomena generate/constitute phenomenal states\n4. Intrinsic properties of physical phenomena must encompass this power\n5. Own inner awareness reveals that phenomenality is an intrinsic property\n\t1. Potentially problematic\n\t2. Supposes the introspection gives us access to the essential nature of our conscious states\n\t3. A careful phenomenological investigation of qualia reveals that they are always situated and invested with vital, affective, and embodied value so are relational, not intrinsic. Qualia must have content \n6. Phenomenality is the only intrinsic property we know of\n7. So phenomenality must be an intrinsic property of physical phenomena, or at least of certain organized physical systems\n\n## Strawson's Panpsychism[^1]\n[Physicalism](thoughts/Materialism.md) actually entails panpsychism\n\n1. [[thoughts/monism|Monism]] is true (there is only one kind of 'stuff' in the universe)\n2. Experiential phenomena are real phenomena (denies illusionism: see [philosophical realism](thoughts/philosophical%20realism.md)))\n3. All concrete phenomena are physical\n4. Therefore experiential phenomena are physical\n5. The emergence of experiential being from non-experiential beings does not make sense. If this were true, the experiential would need to wholly depend on the non-experiential. This can't possible be the case: we have no model for it and can't make sense of it\n6. So, at least some elementary physical phenomenal must also be experiential (micropsychism)\n7. If at least some elementary physical phenomena must also be experiential, it's far more likely that all of them are (otherwise there would be radical heterogeneity edging on dualism and we are assuming that monism is true)\n8. Therefore, panpsychism is true\n\n[^1]: This content is sourced from Professor [Evan Thompson](https://evanthompson.me/)'s course materials for PHIL451A at UBC.

Is this a fair analogy to make? Especially when it doesn't really make sense to apply the 1-2 week sprint concepts to cities which intuitively span much larger timespans.

No opt-in or out process for this type of data collection, no consent.\n\nCurious if this is related to the move towards [real-time content](thoughts/ephemereal%20content.md)\n\nHow much of this can be attributed to the Silicon Value ethic of \"move fast and break things\"? It feels like Sidewalk is extrapolating too much (trying to pull short feedback loops from naturally long timescales of city which operates on multi-year long scales).\n\nIs there a relationship between iteration cycle length and potential impact? Software people are used to iterating quickly without having consequence for each marginal build or project.

Or is rather than these democratic processes are failing so we look to alternatives?\n\nSidewalk feels very much talking into the void and talking to the org, not much talking with each other, no discussion groups. Yes, process and documentation matter, but if there's no input into this [feedback loop](thoughts/feedback%20loops.md), the ideas are just self-reinforcing in an echo chamber. The problem is that large corporations like Alphabet present already-fleshed-out ideas with little room for debate so that 'conversations' and 'feedback' are largely performative.\n\nThe use of \"cheerful minimalism to mask the insidiousness of multinational tech corporations with friendliness and approachability,\" feels very similar to the weird vibe of the [signature corporate art style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFb7BOI_QFc) and why it feels so fake\n\nFrom Jasmine: With software, you can **find** product market fit, ignore edge cases and people who won't make you money, etc. But with cities, you are democratically obligated to build for everyone (or at least the majority)\n\n## Labels and Quantization\nSidewalk feels like a city trying to [label and quantize everything](thoughts/quantization.md)\n\n\u003e Participants are obliged to transform complex spatial phenomena into machine-readable points, lines, and areas, adopting a logic defined by Euro-American geopolitics, settler colonialism, and property relations.\n\n[These maps and markers], while useful and actionable, tended to \"reduce complex life stories and neighborhood histories to 'dots on a map.'\"\n\nData as digital [desire paths](thoughts/desire%20paths.md)?

    "title": "Primary of Consciousness",
    "content": "\nRelated: [[thoughts/consciousness|consciousness]], [[thoughts/monism#Neutral Monism|neutral monism]]\n\n## Primacy of Consciousness\nPHIL451A Paper 3\n\n\u003e Is consciousness primary?\n\nFor something to be primary is for it to be the first and foremost; a prior for all else that comes after it. First, I show how our current understanding of the physical world centres around the primacy of the material. Then, I claim that consciousness is primary – namely existentially, transcendentally, and epistemologically and finally posit a version of neutral monism as a stance on the primacy of consciousness.\n\nHistorically, scientific materialists have argued that science and the scientific method enables us to get ‘outside of experience’ and grasp the world in and of itself. Yet, subjective experience is present at every step. When we observe the cosmos, we do so by formulating theories and models about how we think they work. All of this depends on the subjective experience. We look at the results of our complex telescopic instruments and formulate theories based off of what we have learned and have observed in the world. We pull scientific models from our experiments and observations but again, these are models and idealisations, not actual instantiations of ’things’ in the world.\n\nGottfried Leibniz, Immanuel Kant, Arthur Schopenhauer, and Bertrand Russel were all strong believers that a fully physical account of the world actually offers no explanation of the _intrinsic nature_ of the things within it (Leibniz, 1686; Kant, 1787; Schopenhauer, 1818; Russel, 1959). The ideal gas law tells us how pressure, volume, amount, and temperature of a gas are all related to each other, but tells us nothing about what each of those things in and of themselves are. Chemistry tells us that Carbon has an atomic number of six. At first glance, this may be an intrinsic property. But probe deeper at what an atomic number *is* and all it represents is the number of protons it has. Protons themselves are not ‘real’ things. They are abstractions of how this group of abstractions we call quarks behaves together depending on their relations. Mass is a property that determines how an object will obey the relation $m = \\frac{F}{a}$. Again, it is abstractions all the way down. Purely physical descriptions **tell us not what matter _is_ but what what it _does_.**\n\nPhysics, by name, is supposed to be a mathematical theory of the physical. Yet mathematics, by nature, is purely relational; numbers are quantifiers on abstract objects, formulas describe precise relations between variables. But intuitively, there must also be an _intrinsic nature_ to these objects. _What is an atom in and of itself?_ This question is not answered by a relational account of the world.\n\nIt is tempting to say at this point that perhaps a relational view all there is to reality. After all, this is realistically all that is useful to the functioning of society. It has enabled us to program silicon, photograph the depths of the universe, and predict weather across the world. Yet intuitively, a world held up purely through relations does not make sense. As Hedda Hassel Mørch pointed out in her critique of physics for ignoring consciousness, “for there to be a relation there must be two things being related.” (Mørch, 2017) Otherwise, the relationship is empty – “a show that goes on without performers, or a castle constructed out of thin air.” Mørch posits that all physical relations should be made real by some substance that itself is not purely relational or else there would be no difference between mere mathematical abstraction and the concrete universe.\n\nClearly, if we wish to poke beyond this veil of pure abstractions, our current explanations of our reality will not do: intrinsic natures simply cannot be captured through a purely physical approach. Materialism as given so far does not seem to stand. Taking its physical description as the totality is like **confusing the map with the territory.** It may be fine if you just need the map to navigate the world, but to open one’s eyes to the real world, we must dig deeper. Here, I propose that perhaps consciousness is fundamental to reality, not the other way around -- that consciousness is _primary_.\n\nIt almost self-evident that consciousness is **existentially primary** – it is through the subjective human experience, that the universe is disclosed to us. Arthur Eddington argued that the one thing we know concretely about consciousness is that has an intrinsic nature (Eddington, 1927). As René Descartes famously said in his Second Meditation, “cogito, ergo sum”: I think, therefore I am. It is the foundation upon which Descartes builds upon his certainty in his knowledge about the world. In all the ways we can be mistaken about reality, consciousness is not one of them – it is a reality that we apprehend directly and without inference. Thus, consciousness is existentially primary.\n\nConsciousness is also **transcendentally primary**. Kant defined transcendental primacy as all knowledge which is “occupied not so much with objects as with the mode of our knowledge of objects in so far as this mode of knowledge is to be possible a priori.” (Kant, 1787) In more colloquial language, the transcendental primacy of consciousness refers to how consciousness is not another object of knowledge, but that by which any object can become _knowable_.\n\nEdmund Husserl, in his 1936 work _The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology,_ defines a concept called the _life-world_. Roughly defined, it refers to the world as it is collectively experienced. Husserl likened this model of consciousness to our visual horizon: it is not really an object, but a rather a process of uncovering or displaying potentialities (Husserl, 1936).\n\nIt is in this way then that the horizonal sense of consciousness is not something that can be _had,_ but rather something we _live_. Quoting Bertrand Russel, “we know nothing about the intrinsic quality of physical events except when these are mental events that we directly experience.” (Russel, 1919) As such, consciousness is transcendentally primary.\n\nConsciousness is additionally **epistemically primary** – it is the source and destination of all knowledge. In creating models, we set aside aspects of experience on which we have doubts about (e.g. our senses, emotions, etc.) and extract idealised and abstract models (e.g. mathematics, physics, logic). Even the most abstract physical relation or mathematical formulas describe some ‘real’ thing we are trying to model or express a relation between. These models ideals and models are only as useful insofar as we can implement these abstractions as things we can use to measure, predict, and control phenomena within our lived experience. In this way, consciousness is epistemically primary.\n\nI will pause here to clarify that I am _not_ claiming consciousness to be ontologically primary. I am not making any sort of panpsychist claim that consciousness exists as a fundamental aspect of reality where everything has a small amount of consciousness. Neither am I claiming that consciousness exists inherently in the natural world as a fundamental aspect of reality.\n\nRather, I am positing a form of **neutral monism** that sits somewhere between physicalism and idealism. Monism, in its simplest form, suggests that there is only one ‘kind’ of underlying reality. A neutral stance on this does not side with either matter or mind, instead a potential 3rd substance. Russel explained this form of reality as having “a single underlying nature that is _neither_ mental nor physical but capable of being expressed in these two different ways.” (Russel, 1919) Much like the interiors and exterior of any object, Russel’s account of the mental and physical imply and necessitate each other as reflection of a single nature.\n\nIn Husserl’s horizon metaphor, the horizon is not possible without a world to be observed but the world also cannot be perceived without a perceiver. Similarly, the ‘horizon’ of consciousness is not possible without the physical but the the physical cannot be perceived without the mental. It is absurd to try to reduce one completely to another.\n\nFrancisco Varela’s notion of “mutually generative constraints,” (Varela, 1996) points toward a possibility where both physicalism and idealism work together towards reciprocal enrichment:\n\n1. Phenomenological reports may help to pick out and ascribe meaning to previously unnoticed neural configurations\n2. Neurological findings may become an incentive for re-categorization and further development in phenomenological research\n\nIt is in this neutrally monistic view that one can acknowledge consciousness as primary without necessarily needing to discount our existing objective knowledge about the world. This neutrally monistic view of consciousness does not ‘solve’ the hard problem. Rather, the problem never even arises because the physical world is no longer the standard for being, and objectivity is no longer the ultimate standard of being.\n\n### Citations\n- Bitbol, M.

The horizon is real: it is the farthest point the eye can see before the Earth's surface curves away beneath our view\n2. The horizon is ideal: it is a structure of perception but not something that actually exists independent of perception\n\nThe horizon is a phenomenal structure of consciousness, not a particular phenomenal property (quale) or phenomenal content. Both [qualia](thoughts/qualia.md) and other phenomenal contents always appear from within the horizon of consciousness.\n\nConsciousness then in the horizonal sense is not something we 'have', it is something we live in. There is no way to step outside consciousness and measure it against something else because inside the horizon is all we know\n\nThe horizon itself is [empty](thoughts/emptiness.md).\n\nKant defines 'transcendental knowledge' as knowledge which is occupied not so much with objects as with the mode of our knowledge of objects in so far as this mode of knowledge is to be possible *a priori*. Consciousness then is not another object of knowledge, but that by which any object is knowable -- consciousness is irreducible to the domain of objects.\n\n![Merleau-Ponty on the world and consciousness](thoughts/images/Merleau-Ponty%20on%20the%20world%20and%20consciousness.png)*Merleau-Ponty on the world and consciousness*\n\n### Two conceptions on the world and the universe\nDefine the life-world as the space of meaning within which anything is intelligible and thinkable\n\n1. Natural Science: the universe contains the life-world\n2. Philosophy: the life-world contains the universe; the universe is always disclosed to us from within the life-world\n\n## The Blind Spot\nAdam Frank, Marcelo Gleiser, Evan Thompson in *Aeon*\n\nScientific materialists will argue that the scientific method enables us to get outside of experience and grasp the world as it is in itself. But experience is present at every step. Scientific models must be pulled out from observations, often mediated by our complex scientific equipment. They are idealisations, not actual things in the world.\n\n\"In principle, it is absurd to think that we can explain consciousness by reducing it to certain objects of science, since these objects are abstract relational structures extracted from the life-world of lived experience\" (Husserl)\n\nQuantum-Bayesianism (QBism) combines quantum information theory and Bayesian probability theory. It interprets the irreducible probabilities of a quantum state not as an element of reality, but *as the degrees of belief an agent has about the outcome of a measurement*. In other words, making a measurement is like making a bet on the world’s behaviour, and once the measurement is made, updating one’s knowledge.\n\nAdvocates of this interpretation sometimes describe it as ‘participatory realism’, because human agency is woven into the process of doing physics as a means of gaining knowledge about the world. From this viewpoint, the equations of quantum physics don’t refer just to the observed atom but also to the observer and the atom taken as a whole in a kind of ‘observer-participancy’\n\nThe upshot: there is no simple way to remove our experience as scientists from the characterization of the physical world. Observing it doesn't only affect the measurement, observing it *is* the measurement\n\nScientific knowledge then is a self-correcting narrative made from the world and our experience of it evolving together (see [[thoughts/philosophy of science|Karl Popper's Philosophy of Science]])\n\n## Is Consciousness Primary?\nMichel Bitbol in *NeuroQuantology*\n\nPosits that consciousness is methodological and existentially primary\n\n- Consciousness is not *something*\n\t- Nouns refer to some manipulable or abstract object. But an object is an entity which supposedly exists independently of situations and subjective states.\n\t- This cannot possibly be the case as consciousness as experience is situated -- it is what it feels like to be *a* subject/what it feels like to be\n\nArguing that consciousness is existentially primary and not [[thoughts/ontology|ontologically]] secondary to matter. Sartre: \"consciousness is never merely possible apart from existing; it is no possible instantiation of a definition apart from being actual\"\n\n\u003e They have forgotten that objective knowledge is 'made possible' by carving the lacuna of first person experience within it... scientists who believe that solving many such \"easy problems\" about consciousness will finally clear up the harder problem of its physical origin, look like somebody who believes one can finally reach the horizon by walking far enough\n\nIn the same way as the walker ignores the category gap between a line *in* space and an apparent line seen *through* space, these scientists ignore the category gap between the exclusively structural connections provided by science and the absolute and the absolute of experience analyzed through a structured framework\n\nTwo approaches to overcome the [[thoughts/Hard problem of consciousness#Explanatory Gap|explanatory gap]] both fail\n1. Absolutizing some properties of matter\n\t- If anything can be called \"absolute\", it is conscious experience\n\t\t- Lived experience is immediately and completely given from a self-evidential standpoint\n\t\t- Future experience can by no means *disconfirm* its existence here and now, but only take its place -- it is absolute in the sense that it is indubitable whenever it is present\n\t- Searle: \"Consciousness is the very fact that there is appearance; appearance is the reality of consciousness\"\n\t- Something like \"it appears red\" instead of \"it *is* red\". The subjective statement is admittedly indisputable, but the fact is not. This is a *functional absolutization* of the statement\n2. Relativizing/structuralizing experience\n\t- Karl Mannheim: coordinating the variety of individual or collective perspectives entails an ever increasing formalization of knowledge\n\t- Cassirer: history of science as a whole tends towards relinquishment of substantial and toward research of \"invariant relations\" instead\n\t\t- If properties are referred to, it is only after the concept of property has been redefined in such a way that it includes in itself the concept of relation\n\t- The problem: accounting for the self-evidentially *absolute* conscious experience in terms of the *relational* concepts of objective science\n\t\t- Chalmers and Strawson both attempt to overcome this conflict in naturalist terms, seeking to explain it in terms of some hidden *nonrelational* property\n\t\t- Leibnizian *Monadology*: \"we can attribute to substances no other intrinsic state than that whereby we ourselves inwardly determine our sense\"\n\nPotential solutions\n1. Instead of absorbing or reducing contents of experience or phenomenological reports into the structural network of objective science, strive towards *embedding* these experiences within a broader relational network of which the law-like relations of the objective domain is only a fraction\n2. Varela's notion of \"mutually generative constraints\" towards reciprocal alteration and enrichment of experiential and objective concepts\n\t1. Phenomenological reports may help to pick out and ascribe meaning to previously unnoticed neural configurations\n\t2. Neurological findings may become an incentive for re-categorization and further development in phenomenological research\n\nThese are not 'solutions' to the [[thoughts/Hard problem of consciousness|hard problem]] per-se but rather dissolves it. It does not arise because the physical world is no longer the standard for being, and objectivity is no longer the ultimate standard of method.",

Think of it like Redis but with MongoDB style documents — all of which is on-disk, human-readable, and through a REST API. The project is fully written in Go and is thoroughly unit-tested. It features a standalone server binary which creates a nanoDB server, as well as a shell which allows you to do some basic document inspection.\n\nBuilt with: Docker, Go\n\n## readAR -- an AR app to help those with learning disabilities\n\n[DevPost (TreeHacks 2020, Microsoft Azure Champ Prize - Hack for Good)](https://devpost.com/software/readar-twh41m), [GitHub](https://github.com/jackyzha0/treehacks2020-backend)\n\nreadAR is a mobile AR app re-renders text to be more dyslexic-friendly, and adds context-dependent word definitions and images. A custom BERT model was created and trained for word sense disambiguation (WSD), achieving a 76.6% F1% score on the test dataset which is only ~5% away from state-of-the-art. This model is served through Flask on an Oracle VM Instance. The API is also responsible for our image processing pipeline, which is a conglomerate of different Azure APIs (OCR, Text Analytics, Bing Search).\n\nBuilt with: PyTorch, Flask, Docker, Azure, Oracle Cloud, Python, Bash\n\n## Impostor -- group pomodoro timer with a twist\n\n[Devpost (Finalist at DubHacks 2020, Disney Prize)](https://devpost.com/software/impostor), [GitHub](https://github.com/h4ckh0use)\n\nImposter is a productivity timer designed to keep friends on task together even when working remotely. The Chrome extension monitors your browser tabs, checking against a blocklist of unproductive sites. If one of those websites is visited, the backend will be notified via Firebase and will notify all users in the room through a WebSocket connection. Chat and character customization is also supported.\n\nBuilt with: Firestore, WebSockets, Node.js, Heroku, JavaScript\n\n## Speech2Braille -- a wearable device to transcribe speech\n\n[Paper (Silver + 10k in awards at Canada Wide Science Fair)](res/gvrsf_report.pdf), [GitHub](https://github.com/jackyzha0/Speech2Braille)\n\nSpeech2Braille was created to help the over 360 million people in the world who have debilitating hearing loss. This project entailed creating an end-to-end speech recognition system using an Deep LSTM and a portable device to display braille. The device is able to recognize audio and transcribe it into Braille through the haptic feedback device via a novel neural network architecture. The feedback device is a self-made GPIO hat, consisting of 6 solenoids. The neural network itself is 2 layered LSTM-CTC network with 256 hidden cells in each layer, achieving 92% state-of-the-art word error rate on the TIMIT dataset.\n\nBuilt with: Tensorflow, numpy, Raspberry Pi, Python, Bash\n\n## PacketBook -- blockchain banking without [Internet](thoughts/Internet.md)\n\n[Devpost (nwHacks 2018 SAP Prize, Top 30)](https://devpost.com/software/packetbook), [GitHub](https://github.com/jackyzha0/PacketBook)\n\nPacketBook is a financial accessibility chatbot, fully accessible through the SMS (text messaging) protocol. Users are able to issue simple commands to register, check their balance, deposit, withdraw, and send money. These commands are secured with two-factor authentication through a Flask server on Heroku with Twilio. The backend that handles transaction is written with Node and Express and deployed on stdlib. PacketBook is unique in that it leverages the Stellar blockchain and tokens (XLM) for its transactions which greatly reduces operating overhead with its minimal transaction costs (around 1/100 of a cent per transaction).\n\nBuilt with: MongoDB, Node.js, Express, Flask, Stellar, Heroku, JavaScript, Python",

    "title": "Raft Consensus Algorithm",
    "content": "\n\u003e An understandable [[thoughts/consensus|consensus]] algorithm.\n\nA distilled version of the [Raft paper](https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf). For a more graphic version, see this [visualization of Raft by The Secret Lives of Data](http://thesecretlivesofdata.com/raft/).\n\nA really good [video review of the algorithm by Martin Kleppmann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXEYuDwm7e4\u0026list=PLeKd45zvjcDFUEv_ohr_HdUFe97RItdiB\u0026index=18)\n\n## Distributed Consensus\nWhen you only have one machine, it is easy to figure out what the state of that machine is in. But what happens when you have multiple machines that need to agree on some value or state?\n\nHow do we arrive at a shared set of state across multiple machines that can be as far as opposite sides of the world? How do we handle machines crashing and become unable to respond to incoming requests?\n\nThis is the problem of *distributed consensus*\n\n## Replicated State Machines\nGenerally, this is done using a log of actions that are *replicated* across all machines. Keeping this replicated log consistent between all the machines is the job of the *consensus algorithm*. They allow a collection of machines to agree on some shared state which still make sense even when there is latency or unavailability.\n\nIn more formal language, consensus algorithms should typically have the following properties:\n1. Safety in the face of network delays, partitions, packet loss, duplication, and reordering (except under certain cases where there are no known solutions, e.g. [[thoughts/fault tolerance#Byzantine Faults|Byzantine Faults]])\n2. Functional (available) as long as the majority of servers are operational and can communicate\n3. Latency resilient and does not depend on timing of messages to ensure consistency\n\nRaft is one such consensus algorithm for managing a replicated log. It is an alternative to [Paxos](\u003chttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\u003e) which is the main consensus algorithm in use over the last decade. The main aim is to make it *understandable* to builders and students alike.\n\nIt is important to note that Raft assumes that all messages have been authenticated/authourized. It hands this responsibility to the [[thoughts/Transport Layer|transport layer]] to deal with. As such, Raft *does not have any protection against malicious actors*. More discussion in this [Google Groups conversation](https://groups.google.com/g/raft-dev/c/8WIrWfzIkvM).\n\n## Consensus\nRaft implements consensus by first electing a *leader*, then giving that leader temporary but complete responsibility for managing the replicated log. When a leader fails or becomes disconnected, a new leader is elected.\n\nGiven this approach, Raft decomposes this consensus into 3 independent subproblems\n1. Leader election: how do we choose a new leader when an existing leader fails?\n2. Log replication: how does the leader accept new log entries from clients and replicate them across all the other machines?\n3. Safety: when is it safe to consider log entries as 'agreed upon' and fully replicated across all machines?\n\nA server can only be in one of 3 states:\n1. Leader: handles all client requests\n2. Follower: issues no requests but respond to requests from leaders and candidates \n3. Candidate: used to elect a new leader\n\nState transitions follow the state diagram below:\n![[thoughts/images/raft-state-diagram.png]]\n\nAll Raft servers communicate using remote procedure calls (RPCs) that happen over the network. The basis consensus algorithm only requires 2 types of RPCs, RequestVote and Append-Entries. These are retried if a request times out and are issued in parallel for best performance.\n\n## Leader Election\nLeaders are active for *terms* of arbitrary length (this is randomly determined as we will see later). These are numbered with consecutive and monotonically increasing integers.\n\nEach term begins with an election in which one or more candidates attempt to become leader. If a candidate wins the election, then it serves as leader for the rest of the term.\n\n![[thoughts/images/raft-elections.png]]\n\n### Initiate State\nServers start up in the follower state.\n\nA server remains in the follower state as long as it receives valid RPCs from a leader or candidate (this is usually in the form of a 'heartbeat' from a leader which is an empty AppendEntries [[thoughts/RPC|RPC]] with no log entries).\n\nIf a follower receives no communication over a period of time called the *election timeout* (randomized between 150ms and 300ms), then it assumes there is no viable leader and begins an election to choose a new leader.\n\n### Beginning an Election\nA follower increments its current term and transitions to candidate state. It then votes for itself and issues RequestVote RPCs in parallel to each of the other servers in the cluster.\n\nIt is important to note that a server can only vote once per election. *It will give its vote to the first server that asks for it and meets the requirements for election.* A server should *only* vote for a candidate if the candidate's log is more up-to-date than its own. If the logs have different terms, the one with the larger term is more up to date. If the logs have the same term, the longer log is more up-to-date.\n\nA candidate remains a candidate until one of 3 events happens:\n1. It wins the election. It received votes from a majority of servers in the cluster. Majority rule ensures that at most one candidate can win the election for a particular term. It then sends heartbeat messages to all other servers to establish authority and prevent new elections.\n2. Another server establishes itself as leader. Received an AppendEntries [[thoughts/RPC|RPC]] from another server claiming to be leader. This claim is legitimate if the leader's term is at least as large as the candidate's current term.\n3. A period of time goes by with no winner. Possible if many followers become candidates at the same time, votes can be split so no candidate wins majority. When this happens, each candidate times out and starts a new election by incrementing its term and initiating another election. Raft uses randomized election timeouts to ensure split votes are rare.\n\nAfter a leader has been elected, it beings servicing client requests.\n\n### Properties\nGenerally, Raft will be able to elect and maintain a steady leader as long as the system roughly follows the timing requirement: `broadcastTime \u003c 10 * electionTimeout \u003c 100 * MTBF` where `broadcastTime` is amount of time for a server to send an [[thoughts/RPC|RPC]] to every server in the cluster and `MTBF` is the mean time between failure for a server.\n\nBroadcast time should be roughly an order of magnitude less than the election timeout so that leaders can reliably send heartbeat messages required to keep followers from starting elections (similar to having RTT be roughly a magnitude smaller than request timeout). \n\nThe election timeout should be a few orders of magnitude less than MTBF so that the system makes steady progress. When a system crashes, it will be down for roughly the period of the election timeout.\n\n## Log Replication\nEach client request is a command to be executed by the replicated state machines. The leader appends the command to its own log as a new entry, then issues AppendEntries RPCs in parallel to each of the other servers to replicate the entry.\n\nA single log entry contains the state machine command from the client request along with the term number when the entry was received by the leader. A log entry is considered 'safely replicated' or *committed* once it is replicated on a majority of servers.\n\nAfter an entry is committed, it applies the entry to its own state machine and returns the result of that execution to the client. When a follower learns a log entry is committed, it too applies the entry to its own state machine.\n\nThe *Log Matching Property* is maintained by Raft which guarantees\n1. Log entries with same index and term number store the same command\n2. Log entries with same index and term number mean that all preceding entries must identical (all log entries prior to that index are correctly replicated)\n\nWhen a leader comes to power, it just begins normal operation, and the logs automatically converge in response to failures of the AppendEntries consistency check.\n\nTo bring a follower's log into consistency with its own, the leader must find the latest log entry where the two logs agree. To do this, the leader keeps a value `nextIndex` for each follower which is the number of the *next log entry the leader will send to that follower*. The leader pings each follower with a AppendEntries [[thoughts/RPC|RPC]] call with that `nextIndex` value. If this call is successful, the leader knows that this follower is up to date. If it fails, then the leader decrements `nextIndex` again until it reaches a log entry that does succeed.  At this point, the follower's logs will be removed (as anything between `nextIndex` and what the follower currently has is conflicting) and the follower's log is now consistent with the leader's and will remain that way for the rest of the term.\n\n## Unbounded Logs (Log Compaction)\nIn a practical system, a log cannot grow without bounds. The simplest solution is to use snapshotting where the entire current system state is written to a snapshot on stable storage, then the entire log up until that point is discarded.\n\nAll snapshots are taken independently by each server. Each snapshot contains data like last included index, last included term, and the state machine state.\n\nSometimes, snapshots need to be sent from leader to followers if the followers lag behind using the InstallSnapshot [[thoughts/RPC|RPC]]. This can happen when the leader has discarded the next log entry that needs to be send to a follower (e.g. new server joining cluster).\n\nWhen a server receives a InstallSnapshot [[thoughts/RPC|RPC]] call, it usually discard its entire log. In the odd case where the server receiving the [[thoughts/RPC|RPC]] call has *more* entries in its log than the snapshot, it deletes all log entries covered by the snapshot but entries following the snapshot are still valid and must be kept.\n\nOther options like log cleaning and log-structured merge trees are also possible.\n\n## RPCs\nAll Raft RPCs are idempotent so sending multiple RPCs causes no harms (e.g. telling a follower to AppendEntries it already has does nothing). \n\n```rust\ntype NodeId = u64 // can be pretty much anything that satisfies Ord + Clone + Display\n\nstruct LogEntry {\n\tpayload: Any\n\tterm: u64\n}\n\nstruct Server {\n\t// Persistent State\n\tid: NodeId\n\t// last term we have seen\n\tcurrentTerm: u32\n\t// id of server that received our vote in current term\n\tvotedFor: Option\u003cNodeId\u003e\n\tlog: Vec\u003cLogEntry\u003e\n\n\t// Volatile State\n\t// index of highest log entry known to be committed\n\tcommitIndex: u32\n\t// index of highest log entry applied to state machine\n\tlastApplied: u32\n\n\t// Volatile State on leaders\n\t// map of server id -\u003e index of the next log entry to send to that server\n\t// initialize all to last log index + 1\n\tnextIndex: Map\u003cNodeId, u32\u003e\n\t// map of server id -\u003e index of highest log entry known to be replicated\n\t// initialize all to 0\n\tmatchIndex: Map\u003cNodeId, u32\u003e\n}\n\nimpl Server {\n\t// Invoked by leader to replicate log entries, also used as heartbeat\n\t// Returns: (term, success)\n\t//   term: currentTerm for leader to update itself\n\t//   success: true if follower contained entry matching prevLogIndex and prevLogTerm\n\tfn appendEntries(\n\t\t\u0026mut self,\n\t\tterm: u32,          // leader's term\n\t\tleaderId: NodeId,   // so follower can redirect clients\n\t\tprevLogIndex: u32,  // index of log entry immediately preceding new ones\n\t\tprevLogTerm: u32,   // term of prevLogIndex entry\n\t\tentries: [LogEntry] // log entries to store\n\t\tleaderCommit: u32   // leader's commit index\n\t) -\u003e (u32, bool) {\n\t\t// If a server receives a request with a stale term number, it rejects the request.\n\t\tif term \u003c self.currentTerm {\n\t\t\tfalse\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t// Consistency check for second property of Log Matching Property:\n\t\t// If two entries in different logs have the same index and term,\n\t\t// then the logs are identical in all preceding entries.\n\t\tif self.log[prevLogIndex].term != prevLogTerm {\n\t\t\tfalse\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t// Remove any conflicting entries in the follower's log\n\t\t// Conflict is defined as when an entry has the same index but different terms\n\t\tfor (i, entry) in entries.vec().enumerate() {\n\t\t\tlet our_term = self.log.get_term(i);\n\t\t\tif our_term != entry.term {\n\t\t\t\tself.log.drain(i..self.log.len())\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t\t\n\t\t// Appends entries from the leader's log that are not already in the log\n\t\tfor (i, entry) in entries.vec().enumerate() {\n\t\t\tif i == self.log.len() + 1 {\n\t\t\t\tself.log.append(entry)\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t\t\n\t\t// Update commitIndex if applicable\n\t\tif leaderCommit \u003e self.commitIndex {\n\t\t\t// set commit index to be the minimum of leaderCommit and index of last new entry\n\t\t\tself.commitIndex = min(leaderCommit, self.log.len() - 1);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\t\n\tfn requestVote(\n\t\t\u0026mut self,\n\t\tterm: u32,           // candidate's term\n\t\tcandidateId: NodeId, // candidate requesting vote\n\t\tlastLogIndex: u32,   // index of candidate's last log entry\n\t\tlastLogTerm: u32,    // term of candidate's last log entry\n\t) -\u003e (u32, bool) {\n\t\t// If a server receives a request with a stale term number, it rejects the request.\n\t\tif term \u003c self.currentTerm {\n\t\t\tfalse\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t// Only grant vote if we haven't voted this term and candidate's log is\n\t\t// at least as up-to-date as our log\n\t\tif self.votedFor.is_none() \u0026\u0026 lastLogIndex \u003e= self.log.len() - 1 {\n\t\t\ttrue\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t// Don't vote by default\n\t\tfalse\n\t}\n}\n```",

  "/thoughts/Rhizome-Proposal": {
    "title": "Rhizome Proposal",
    "content": "\nA short proposal and outline for my summer research in 2022 focussed on building infrastructure for **collaborative local-first applications**.\n\n\u003e Perhaps the current episteme is best rendered as a rhizome: a subterranean plant stem that can shoot out roots that grow, hydralike, even when snipped in two... a system without beginning or end, “always in the middle, between things, interbeing, intermezzo.” [--Claire Webb in Noema](https://www.noemamag.com/the-ladder-the-sphere-and-the-rhizome/)\n\n## Motivation and Values\n\nImagine a web where you can bring all of your data from Roam to Obsidian or Google Drive to Dropbox without needing to worry about how to make the file types work or massage the output of one API into another.\n\nImagine a web where your applications don't just stop working when you lose internet connection or some company intern accidentally takes down production.\n\nImagine a web where it is *easy* and *normal* to create vast and rich collaborative spaces that allow you co-browse the internet and collectively [[posts/digital-gardening|digital garden]] with friends.\n\nImagine a web where your digital spaces feel like portable universes and community gardens.\n\n---\n\nMy goal is to answer the question: **What would something like this look like if it were possible?** \n\nIn short, *Rhizome* is an attempt to decouple data from applications. Below are properties that Rhizome will optimize for.\n\n### Interoperable\nData on the web today is mostly treated as second-class to applications. In this form, data is contextual -- it only makes sense in the context of what you can do in an application. At its best, developers and companies expose this data in the form of an API, not allowing you to actually access the underlying data but rather only giving you a limited range of actions or verbs that you can perform on it.\n\nThis is known as *verb-based interoperability* and it [creates a form of n-to-n problem](https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1452438198668328960) where every app needs to know what the APIs of another app are to even begin to interoperate. Data exported in this form rarely makes sense on its own outside of the application and often requires a lot of glue code in order to make the data the right format so that you can pass it off to the next application. In fact, companies are *incentivized* to not provide an easily understandable format that users can easily export. Why would they make it easier for people to leave their product?\n\nUsers shouldn't have to keep using platforms they don't like just because it's impossible to move all the data they have to another. Instead, users should *want* to use platforms because it fits the needs they have.\n\nThis might be possible if we treat data like a **noun**. How do we create sources of truth that are *legible outside of the application*, possibly in ways that the application developer never anticipated? Data-based interoperability can use the shared data directly. Once an app knows how to read a data format, it can read that data regardless of which app produced it.\n\nThis enables users to escape the iron-clad grasp of corporations which hold your data hostage in exchange for usage of their application. Users shouldn't have to sign away all rights to their data when they agree to use app -- they should control what applications have access to their data and how.\n\n### Modular\nWhen users choose to use an application, they generally have no choice but to use the whole stack that application uses.\n\nIn choosing an application, you are ceding agency to the application to decide how it stores the data, how it transforms that data, and how it displays that data. Don't like the way an application looks and the app doesn't give you an option to customize it? Better find a new app or deal with it.\n\nCan we give agency back to users by create modular layers so users can pick and choose what layers they want? Can we make it so these layers are available to others to reuse and adapt to their own needs?\n\n### Local-first\nThe cloud gives us collaboration, but old-fashioned apps give us ownership. Can’t we have the best of both worlds?\n\nWe should be able to use our applications without needing to be connected to an internet to load a 4MB web page. Many modern 'desktop' applications are simply Electron wrappers around a web application, providing no such thing as 'offline-support'.\n\nYour apps shouldn't break as soon as you reach an area with spotty internet connection or when some company's server goes down. When you work with local-first software, your work should continue to be accessible indefinitely, even after the company that produces the software has died. You shouldn't need to worry about companies selling your data to advertisers or using it to train large language models without your permission because you control exactly who has access and permission to your data.\n\nThe internet should be used to synchronize, update, and collaborate, not be a requirement for basic function. Your data should stay on your device unless you say otherwise.\n\n### Collaborative\nOf course, local-first doesn't mean local-only.\n\nIt was a dream of the early internet to be able to make spaces anyone can inhabit and enjoy, little pockets of [[thoughts/digital commons|digital commons]] that are tended to by many. \n\nApps should have the freedom to create new mediums of being digitally present with others. Apps should easily be able to have a digital indication that a space is lived in and occupied.\n\nAs of now, most platforms keep a primative chat log or history but thats it. What if there was a way to create digital [gardens](https://twitter.com/samihusseni/status/1329499588982575104) to foster and maintain existing relationships? A commonspace you could both take care of, share, and contribute to. Completely private common spaces often allow users to put whatever and allow people can construct their own digital nooks and cozy spaces. Places where people can consume the firehose of information through a feed or slow and lazily through Socratic dialogue (see: [friction](thoughts/friction.md), [pace layers](thoughts/pace%20layers.md)).\n\nA collaborative application doesn't necessarily need completely open to the public either. It could just be among your family or close friends. It could just be permeable enough to be discovered by those curious enough to add their own drawings and words and details just hidden enough to be carefully unearthed by the intentional visitor. An app can be a [[thoughts/cozy software#An app can be a home-cooked meal|home-cooked meal]].\n\n### Simple Developer Experience\nLast but not least, the experience should feel pleasant to both build and use.\n\nThere are clearly social problems when it comes to making collaborative apps (e.g. [[thoughts/tragedy of the commons|tragedy of the commons]], [[thoughts/evaporative cooling|evaporative cooling]]), but even *enabling* this collaboration on a technical level to happen in the first place is already really difficult.\n\nThe reason why client-server is so much easier to develop is because of ACID properties. Everything is atomic, things are easy to reason about. P2P and distributed technologies generally are much more difficult to reason about with things like eventual consistency making it hard to understand what is *actually* happening in the code. Networking quirks like NAT traversal make direct connections \n\nPeople tend to lean towards client-server models because nobody has made it easy to make P2P software. Almost everything today requires users to still setup their own signalling servers, STUN servers, ICE servers, and a bunch of other infrastructure that makes client-server applications seem like child play.\n\nBut what if developers didn't have to worry about server hosting *or* complexities of eventual consistency? Can we make the tech really easy to build so even hobbyists can quickly spin up a chat app for their own friends that suits their own needs?\n\nThe libraries that enable this form of P2P software should be able to plug and play into existing applications. The experience should be simple enough that your average CS student should be able to write a simple P2P chat app just as easily (if not easier) as if they wrote it as a client-server application.\n\n### Differentiation from existing work\n- [Urbit](https://urbit.org/)\n\t- Claims to be an overlay OS and networking layer\n\t- A bad case of [NIH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here), pretty much reinvented everything from scratch in a language that nobody really understands. Very vaporwavy, not much of their tech lives up to their promises. Good summary [here](https://wejn.org/2021/02/urbit-good-bad-insane/) but TLDR; good in principle, didn't work out in practice.\n\t- No real applications built on top of it.\n\t- Modular collaborative yes, no on everything else.\n\t- -Interoperable +Modular +Local +Collaborative -Developer Experience\n- [Ceramic](https://blog.ceramic.network/what-is-ceramic/)\n\t- Provides a universal document graph (Ceramic Documents) which by default are interoperable, scalable, and permissionless.\n\t- Seems to require a blockchain to anchor storage and provide strict ordering which in turn makes real-time data read/write infeasible (e.g. games, chat).\n\t- Use of DIDs is incredibly smart, potentially enabling self-sovereign identity (SSI) down the line.\n\t- Doesn't seem to support multi-writer documents right out of the box, seems to be an ongoing area of work/research.\n\t- Great principles and solid work already. Seems to have gained some adoption from people in [[thoughts/web3|web3]] already.\n\t- +Interoperable +Modular -Local -Collaborative +Developer Experience\n- Hypercore/Dat Protocol: tbd\n- Yjs: tbd\n\n## Timeline / Labour Estimates\nLabour estimate is roughly 40 hours/week for 16 weeks working on this research with the primary output goal being Rhizome. Secondary artifacts like open-source implementations of various protocols/consensus mechanisms/algorithms as well as comprehensive and understandable notes for various concepts of p2p systems will also be produced and released.\n\nAll bullet points below are releasable artifacts.\n\n### Research / Background Work\n- P2P Readings + Notes - Week 1-3\n\t- DID\n\t- Merkle-DAG\n\t- IPLD\n\t- CID\n\t- [[thoughts/CRDT|CRDT]]\n\t- Yjs\n\t- Hypercore\n\t- SSI\n- Implementation Practice\n\t- Implement [Raft Consensus](https://raft.github.io/#implementations) in Rust - Week 2\n\t- Barebones Hypercore in Rust - Week 3\n\t- Some form of DHT with NAT traversal - Week 2/3\n\t- ... tbd\n### Rhizome Implementation\n- Revise and concretize [[thoughts/Rhizome Specification|Rhizome Specification]]\n- ID Layer - Week 4-7\n- Transport Layer - Week 7-10\n- Logic Layer - Week 10-13\n- Application Layer - Week 13-16\n\t- Potential application: [[thoughts/Lattice Proposal|Lattice -- an experiment on collective sense-making and digital gardening]] [WIP]",

    "title": "Search Diary",
    "content": "\n# Entry 1\n**Day, Time, and Location:** February 6th, ~4:01pm EST, Montreal\n\n**How long did the search take?** ~10 seconds\n\n**Photo showing setting of the search:** No photo, but was sitting at a desk with a couple of friends! Casual co-working time.\n\n**Motivation for the search**: A group of us were chatting and one of my friends mentioned her undergraduate thesis on the concept of vibes as applied to fundamental essences of objects. I was curious if she had heard of the term 'qualia' before as the concepts seemed related. I keep a personal online archive of notes on my website and wanted to surface a relevant link that I read but couldn't remember off of the top of my head. Specifically, looking for this article from [Real Life Mag](https://reallifemag.com/nameless-feeling/?curius=1294).\n\n**Details of the search**: Search term: *qualia*, result was in the first three surfaced\n\n**Device type and Search Engine**: Mobile, site-specific search on my personal site (jzhao.xyz)\n\n**Was the search successful?** Finished within one session! Found the note I was looking for with the first query.\n\n**Reflection on the search:** This is a pretty good representation of the average use-case for searching through my own website. If done well, I have a **shareable representation of my thoughts** that I can send out into the world and access easily from any device anywhere.\n\nSearch is a pretty default entry point for me into my 'second-brain' (more on why in my post on [networked thought](posts/networked-thought.md)). I use search as an entry-point into a single node, then recall by associativity rather than by indexing. But having a good entry-point can make or break my flow into finding what I’m looking for. In this case, I had already known that this note existed in my garden so I just searched by the title of the note.\n\nBecause this search system is still rather brittle, I've learned to start splitting notes into atomic concepts with short, simple nouns like \"[qualia](thoughts/qualia.md)\" and \"[Chesterton's Fence](thoughts/Chesterton's%20Fence.md)\" rather than long winding descriptions, which helps me find and organize notes more easily. The engine operates on an extended version of the bag of words model and as such, I have adapted to mostly searching off of keywords rather than more \"natural language\".\n\n# Entry 2\n**Day, Time, and Location:** February 5th, 10:23pm EST, Montreal\n\n**How long did the search take?** ~30 minutes\n\n**Photo showing setting of the search:** No photo. Sitting at desk with a laptop, slightly groggy.\n\n**Motivation for the search**: I am currently working on a digital version of an essay that a collective of technologists I'm a part of is publishing soon. We are doing last minute polish around performance for lower-end devices that may not be able to handle a lot of the more performance-intensive graphics we have. \n\n**Details of the search**: A collection of searches with queries like \"three js gradient skybox\", \"ScissorCanvas effectcomposer\", and a huge string of other searches. Most results led me to issues on GitHub like https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/6022 and https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/5979.\n\n**Device type and Search Engine**: Laptop, Google + GitHub code search.\n\n**Was the search successful?** None of the search results were able to give me an exact answer but helped provide context into the history of the issue. For example, the second search result let me know that shaderpasses will use the wrong viewport/scissor for rendering if used in conjunction. I ended up using a slightly hacky workaround to achieve the same effect.\n\n**Reflection on the search:** I have had a decent amount of experience making technical searches in the past. A lot of programming *is* just knowing what combination of search terms will make Google spit out the most relevant search results. Most times, Google surfaces relevant and helpful pages and this was no exception. \n\nI tend to use search engines like Google very frequently. As a fast typer, my approach is to just stream words that surface from my head and iteratively refine and re-type queries as I visit and park pages (in the terminology of [information foraging](thoughts/information%20foraging.md), I rely heavily on behaviour enrichments and have a tight goal, forage, refine loop).\n\n# Entry 3\n**Day, Time, and Location:** February 4th, 2:56pm PST, Vancouver\n\n**How long did the search take?** ~5 minutes\n\n**Photo showing setting of the search:** No photo. At desk while on a Discord call with cool folks!\n\n**Motivation for the search**: We were trying to find a fitting banner image for our community Discord we were setting up! I had remembered seeing a very nice solarpunk-themed video commercial on YouTube somewhere but couldn't quite remember the right combination of search times to find it. I *did* remember that it was somehow a yoghurt commercial.\n\n**Details of the search**: Initial search was for \"yoghurt commercial\". After immediately realizing this was not specific enough, I asked in the Discord call if people remember the name of the company and then modified it to \"Chobani commercial solarpunk\" and finally \"Chobani commercial solarpunk but no product placement\" to remove all the product placement.\n\n**Was the search successful?** Eventually found the \"Dear Alice\" video that I was looking for! [Video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqJJktxCY9U)\n\n**Reflection on the search**: This was a really interesting example of search in a more 'collaborative' fashion. A lot of my information recall happens via association and the more people to help fill in gaps in memory, the faster I am able to find the thing I am looking for. This search in particular took two 'hops' of refinement.\n\n# Entry 4\n**Day, Time, and Location:** January 28th, 2:58pm PST, Vancouver\n\n**How long did the search take?** ~1 minute\n\n**Photo showing setting of the search:** No photo. At desk, messaging people on Facebook while eating a meal.\n\n**Motivation for the search**: One of my close friends has been experimenting with the concept of telescopic text (an example: https://www.telescopictext.org/text/KPx0nlXlKTciC). There was a really interesting interaction design experiment that one of my mutual friends on Twitter has been experimenting with that I wanted to share (this one in particular: https://twitter.com/azlenelza/status/1487153246531579905)\n\n**Details of the search**: I had remembered that I bookmarked this tweet reply at some point so the first place I looked was my Bookmarks tab in Twitter. Twitter's search is notoriously bad so I just scrolled chronologically and used cmd+f liberally until I found the tweet.\n\n**Was the search successful?** Yes! I found what I was looking for relatively quickly. It also 'mentally' refreshed a few ideas I had forgotten I had bookmarked like this really cool scoping interaction (https://twitter.com/wcrichton/status/1487223891751694339).\n\n**Reflection on the search**: I think this interaction is really interesting because it is often representative of behaviour on sites where the search system is either non-existent or poorly designed. In these cases, I rely heavily on interaction enrichments like using in-browser search and F-scanning (more on F-scanning: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content/) of the tweet profile pictures to quickly comb through content. Of course, if this was much further back in time than a few weeks, this would have been a monumentally more difficult search to make.",

Traditional blockchains like [[thoughts/bitcoin|Bitcoin]] function by [[thoughts/proof of work|proof of work]].\n\nThe whole philosophy behind it is:\n\n-   Running the function takes some time\n-   Running the function is the only way to produce the output\n-   With the known input and output of the function, the only way of evaluating the output is to re-execute the function with the provided input\n\nThis guarantees that when an output is valid for an input, some time has passed for producing that output.\n\n## Tower BFT\nPractical [[thoughts/fault tolerance#Byzantine Faults|Byzantine Fault Tolerance]] which uses proof of history as a reliable source of time.\n\nFrom [Solana Documentation](https://docs.solana.com/implemented-proposals/tower-bft)\n\n\u003e The basic idea to this approach is to stack consensus votes and double lockouts. Each vote in the stack is a confirmation of a fork. Each confirmed fork is an ancestor of the fork above it. Each vote has a `lockout` in units of slots before the validator can submit a vote that does not contain the confirmed fork as an ancestor.\n\u003e \n\u003e When a vote is added to the stack, the lockouts of all the previous votes in the stack are doubled (more on this in [Rollback](https://docs.solana.com/implemented-proposals/tower-bft#Rollback)). With each new vote, a validator commits the previous votes to an ever-increasing lockout. At 32 votes we can consider the vote to be at `max lockout` any votes with a lockout equal to or above `1\u003c\u003c32` are dequeued (FIFO). Dequeuing a vote is the trigger for a reward. If a vote expires before it is dequeued, it and all the votes above it are popped (LIFO) from the vote stack. The validator needs to start rebuilding the stack from that point.\n\n## Turbine\nSimilar to data sharing approaches in [[thoughts/peer-to-peer|p2p]], seed chunks to peers that can then share amongst themselves.\n\n## Gulf Stream\n\u003e Each Validator knows the order of upcoming Leaders due to Solana's architecture. So clients and Validators forward transactions to upcoming Leaders before they act as a Leader in the network. This allows Validators to start processing transactions ahead of time. This results in fewer transactions cached in Validators’ memory and faster confirmations.\n\nIsn't this potentially problematic? If all nodes know what the upcoming leader is, couldn't they just DDoS the next leader?\n\n## Archiver Nodes\nIf each node in the network was required to store that much data, a limited group of participants who could afford and manage that kind of storage, could join the network and this makes the network centralized.\n\nPoRep stands for proof of replication and it’s a system introduced by Filecoin initially in which a prover defends a publicly verifiable claim that it is dedicating unique resources to storing one or more retrievable replicas of a data file.\n\nOccasionally, the network will ask/challenge the archivers to prove they’re doing their job of storing data and at this point, archivers should complete PoRep.",

A ‘river’ or a ‘stream’ are the metaphors by which it is most naturally described. In talking of it hereafter, let us call it the stream of thought, of consciousness, or of subjective life.” – William James, Principles of Psychology\n\n- Gaps and changes in quality that we do notice don't undermine the feeling that our consciousness is continuous (we bridge the gap between pre-gap consciousness easily)\n- Gaps and changes in quality that we don't notice aren't felt as interruptions because we're not aware of them\n- The stream of consciousness is really both a stream of perception and a stream of thought and attention shifts dynamically back and forth between them\n\n\u003e \"When we take a general view of the wonderful stream of our consciousness, what strikes us first is the different [pace](thoughts/pace%20layers.md) of its parts.

    "title": "TCP",
    "content": "\n[[thoughts/Transport Layer|Transport layer protocol]]\n\nWhen a host requires assurance that the remote end has actually received the data it sends. But instead of requesting a signature at the remote end, TCP requires an acknowledgement be returned\n\n## Overview\n1. Point-to-point: one sender, one receiver\n2. Reliable, in-order byte stream: no message boundaries\n3. Pipelined: TCP congestion and flow control set window size\n4. Send and receive buffers (similar to GBN and SR)\n5. Full duplex data: bi-directional data flow in same connection\n\t1. MSS: maximum segment size\n6. Connection-oriented: handshaking initializes both sender and receiver state before data exchange\n7. Flow controlled: sender will not overwhelm receiver\n\n## Flags\n- SYN (sychronize): packets used to initiate a connection\n- ACK (acknowledgement): packets that are used to confirm that the data packets have been received, also used to confirm the initiation request and tear down requests\n- RST (reset): signify the connection is down or maybe the service is not accepting the requests\n- FIN (finish): indicate that the connection is being torn down. Both sender and receiver send the FIN packets to gracefully terminate the connection\n\n## Connection Establishment\n- Three-way handshake\n- To solve single initial sequence number problem, we randomly choose the initial sequence number\n1. Client sends initial SYN message\n\t1. Sequence number for client to server is specified\n2. Server responds with a SYN/ACK (flip both bits) message\n\t1. Client to server sequence number is confirmed in ACK\n\t2. Server to client initial sequence number is specified\n3. Client sends an ACK message\n\t1. Server to client sequence number is confirmed in ACK\n\n## Window Management\n- Size is selected by the application (if not the default)\n- Both sender and receiver have congestion windows\n\t- Measured with segments of maximum segment size (MSS)\n\t- Size is determined by the presence of absence of congestion\n\t- Actual send window is the min of the flow control window (receiver) and the scaled congestion window (computed by sender)\n- Retransmission strategy\n\t- ACKs correspond to first sequence number not yet received (similar to GBN)\n\t- Receiver stores packets in its own window (like SR)\n\t- Four or more ACKs with same number triggers a retransmission without a timeout\n\t- Retransmit just one segment instead of whole window (like SR)\n\n## Congestion Management\n- Very conservative, at first sign of congestion, cuts congestion window in half\n- When it appears that congestion has eased, it increases slowly (1 segment to congestion window each time)\n- TCP uses bandwidth in a fair way\n- Slow start: always start with a congestion window of 1 segment\n\t- Increase by 1 each time a segment is ACKed (this is exponential, equivalent to doubling each time we send a window full of data)\n\t- Stop doubling when we detect congestion\n\n## Flow Control\nDifference between a sender's sequence number and the remote host's acknowledgement number represents any outstanding, unacknowledged data\n\nACK flag is offset 107\n\nSequence and acknowledgement number are both 32 bit fields so the range is from $0$ to $2^{32}-1$. After all the $2^{32}$ sequence numbers are used up and more data is to be sent, the sequence numbers can be wrapped around and used again from the starting.\n\n## Sequence Number\nOffset 32\n\nTracks number of bytes sent outward by a host. If a TCP packet contains 1400 bytes of data, then the sequence number will be increased by 1400 after the packet is transmitted.\n\n## Acknowledgement Number\nOffset 64\n\nTracks number of bytes **received**. If 1000 bytes are received by a host, it increases the acknowledgement number by 1000 when it sends out a packet in response.\n\nThe flag is set **if the acknowledgement number field contains a valid acknowledgement number**.",

    "title": "The Dragon and the Bridge",
    "content": "\n*Paper #1 for PHIL240A at UBC*\n\n\u003e It's been three weeks now since you woke up deep in a forest. You've managed to survive; the forest itself isn't that bad. But, there's a pack of wolves that keeps trying to hunt you down, and every few days you have to run away from where you've set up camp. This is one of those days. You hear the howling of the wolves and run run run for it... until you break through the tree line and find yourself facing a massive ravine. There's clearly no way to jump, go around, or scale down it. Scanning frantically, you see a rope bridge about half a kilometer away, and you dash toward it. There seems to be some large boulder blocking the entrance, but you'll deal with that when you get there. As you approach, a long neck raises an elegant reptilian head, and two golden eyes turn to regard you. The boulder was a sleeping dragon! You slow down and approach with caution. Dragons are known to be intelligent and mostly benevolent; maybe you can just talk to them and ask them to move. \"Great dragon!,\" you call out. \"Please let me past you onto the bridge. There's a group of wolves coming after me, and I don't want to be eaten.\" The dragon looks askance at you, turns its long neck to look across the ravine, and turns back to you again. \"Bridge? What bridge?,\" they ask. \"The one right behind you,\" you reply, surprised. \"There's a bridge here?,\" the dragon queries, feigning (or not?) confusion. You're stunned. \"Yes, the bridge, it's right there!,\" you say. \"Aha!,\" says the dragon. \"But how do you know there's a bridge here? How can you be certain of what you see, that it's not an illusion, or that all of this isn't a dream? Death approaches you from behind, death looms before you if you fall unsupported into this ravine. Why would you trust that the world has provided you with a bridge?\"\n\u003e \n\u003e Respond from the perspective of Uddyotakara, assuming that he endorses Gautama's verses and Vātsyāyana's comments (see: [epistemology](thoughts/epistemology.md))\n\n---\n\n- **D:** the dragon guarding the bridge\n- **U:** Uddyotakara, a philosopher in the [Nyāya](thoughts/Nyāya.md) school of philosophy, running for their life from wolves. A proponent of [philosophical realism](thoughts/philosophical%20realism.md)\n\n**U:** Great dragon! Please let me pass you so I can cross the bridge.\n\n**D:** But how do you know there's a bridge here? What if your senses deceive you?\n\n**U:** Turn around and see for yourself! Can you not see clearly? There is clearly a rope bridge right behind you.\n\n**[The Dragon turns around.]**\n\n**D:** Hm.. there does not appear to be a bridge. How can you be sure you are not hallucinating a bridge?\n\n**U:** I have trust in my vision -- it is a reliable epistemic instrument. Why doubt my sight now when it has served me faithfully so many times before? I trust that my eyes see I bridge so I believe there is a bridge for me to cross the ravine.\n\nRational inquiry requires purpose. We do not doubt everything, lest we not [trust](thoughts/trust.md) the ground beneath us. (Nyāyasūtra 4.2.33).\n\n**D:** You seem to rely heavily on inductive principles in your reasoning. One cannot infer that \"my vision will always be faithful\" given that it has been faithful in the past. How do you convince yourself that this bridge is not a [black swan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory)? Or that bridges exist at all? Perhaps nothing exists at all.\n\n**U:** Vision is a subset of perception, which is a *pramāna*. It is a means of knowing that is gained through \"close examination of objects through cognition\" (Nyāyasūtra 4.2.29). With the existence of *pramānas* the thesis \"Nothing exists\" cannot possibly be true.\n\nLet us suppose the claim were true and it was supported by a *pramāna*. In which that case, that very *pramāna* would contradict that claim. If there were no *pramāna* to support this claim, then the thesis could not be proved (Nyāyasūtra 4.2.30). Thus, the claim is false. *Pramānas* must exist and *some* things must be real.\n\n**D:** Yet, you cannot be sure that the bridge is real. Your vision can deceive you. Have you not seen a simple magic trick? How do you know the bridge is not a visual illusion or dream?\n\n**U:** Well, first I must get close enough to examine the bridge closely. If it was a visual illusion, I can consult another sense like touch to reinforce my trust in it. But even if it was, say a dream, then I could wake up from it! Both dream wolf and dream bridge would cease to matter.\n\nThe concept of being chased by wolves and the concept of a rope bridge may have been real, but the *physical* risk associated with them would be dissolved. In a dream, things are still *real* in the conceptual sense. For something to have been in a dream, I must have had the *essence* of the object as a prior. There is no concept 'dream wolf' if there is no concept of 'wolf' (Nyāyasūtra 4.2.34-35).\n\n**D:** I concede then that *conceptually* the bridge must exist. Yet, how do you reconcile that with the real and the physical? What if that bridge is actually broken? What if you mistook the bridge for a fallen log?\n\n**U:** That is to say that my cognition of the bridge is erroneous? Do you believe there to be nothing in its place? I cannot make a mistake about what it is unless there is something there that I could be wrong about. What do you see instead?\n\n**[The Dragon takes another glance at the ravine.]**\n\n**D:** I see a log. There is no concept of 'bridge' behind me.\n\n**U:** This is quite the anti-realist argument -- that because you and I see two different things when referring to the same object (due to language understanding, presupposed knowledge, etc.) then the object must therefore have no 'true nature' (Nyāyasūtra 4.2.37).\n\nYet, to even be wrong about something, one needs to mistake something $\\lnot F$ for something $F$ (to see a post as a person). This, of course, happens when the differences between $\\lnot F$ and $F$ are ignored while their similarities are grasped.\n\nWhile either one of us could be wrong about the *true* nature of the thing in the ravine, it is undoubtable that there is something there which has the essence of 'bridge' and 'log' and should be usable to cross the ravine.\n\n**D:** Well, seeing as there is *something* for you to cross the ravine with, you must get going now. The wolves are getting close, I shall let you cross.\n\n**[The Dragon steps aside.]**",

  "/thoughts/The-Grasshopper": {
    "title": "The Grasshopper: Games, Life and Utopia",
    "content": "\n\"It is the attempt to discover and formulate a definition, and to follow the implications of that discovery even when they lead in surprisingly, and sometimes disconcerting, directions.\"\n\n## The Grasshopper\nA fun Platonic dialogue poised as a tale between insects. The grasshopper, about to die for winter, leaves his disciples with a few riddles. Within these tales, the grasshopper details his philosophy of \"refusing to work and insisting upon devoting himself exclusively to play\". Of course, his disciples challenge him about this, leading to a journey of defining what [games](thoughts/games.md) are, attitudes toward playing games, and the role of games in utopias. \n\n(When talking about why the author chose to write the book as a Platonic dialogue) \"His refusal to express himself in a plain expository style is perhaps no different in principle from someone's setting out to write an entire book without using the letter *e*\"\n\n## [Utopia](thoughts/utopia.md) and Scarcity\n\"For one cannot help reflecting that if there were no winters to guard against, then the Grasshopper would not get his come-uppance nor the ant his shabby victory. The life of the grasshopper would be vindicated and that of the ant absurd\"\n\n\"Thus, although time is a finite quantity for everyone, it is not a limited resource for everyone. For a bored person time is a burden; for a person on the rack it is agony. And when time *is* a resource for someone it is not always a limited resource. For a person with very few goals there is always enough time to accomplish all of them.\"\n\n\"[Play](thoughts/play.md) is necessary but not sufficient adequately to account for the ideal of existence\"\n\n## A post-work society\nLet us imagine that all of the instrumental activities of human beings have been eliminated. All of the things ordinarily called work are now done by wholly automated machines which are activated solely by mental telepathy, so that not even a minimum staff is necessary for the housekeeping chores of society.\n\n\"You talk as though there were but two possible alternatives: either a life devoted exclusively to play or a life devoted exclusively to work. But most of us realize that our labour is valuable because it permits us to play, and we are presumably seeking to achieve some kind of balance between work input and play output. People are not, and do not want to be, wholly grasshoppers or wholly ants, but a combination of the two; people are and want to be (if you will forgive a regrettably vulgar but spooneristically inevitable construction) asshoppers or grants. We can, of course, all cease to work, but if we do then we cannot play for long either, for we will shortly die.\"\n\n### Art and Pursuit of Knowledge\nArt has a subject matter which consists in the actions and passions of humanity: with human aspirations and frustrations, hopes and fears, triumphs and tragedies, with flaws of character, moral dilemmas, joy and sorrow. But it would seem that none of these necessary ingredients of art could exist in Utopia, thus there are no artists of any sort in Utopia.\n\nThe acquisition of knowledge, just like the acquisition of anything else, is an instrumental process; that is acquisition is instrumental to possession, no matter what it is. We must therefore assume that all Utopians have acquired all the knowledge there is. Thus, there are no scientists, philosophers, or any other intellectual investigators.\n\nWe can call this state of affairs the **Alexandrian Condition of Man**, after Alexander the Great. When there are no more worlds to conquer, we are not filled with satisfaction but with despair.\n\nThus in Utopia, we need therefore is some activity in which what is instrumental is inseparably combined with what is intrinsically valuable, and where the activity is not itself is not itself an instrument for some further end: games. Games have obstacles which we can strive to overcome *just so that* we can possess the activity as a whole (playing the game).\n\nThe counter-argument though, is the existence of individuals value the means as much as the ends themselves, if not more. Once a scientist or philosopher after great effort solves a major problem he is very let down, and far from rejoicing in the possession of his solution or discovery, he cannot wait to be engaged once more in the quest. **Success is something to shoot at, not to live with**. This seems to dismantle the previous argument dismissing art and pursuit of knowledge as important in a post-work society.\n\nThe resolution to this appears to be the fact that activities which from one point of view be seen as instrumentally valuable can, from another point of view, be intrinsically valuable. For example, we can agree that carpentry is an instrumental activity; that is, instrumental to the existence of houses. But to a person who enjoys building for its own sake, that otherwise instrumental activity has intrinsic value as well. The same could be true of anyone who really enjoys their work, whatever that work might be. I then posit this type of work *as game playing* so thus can exist in Utopia.\n\nEven in a purely abundant world, one can *create* scarcity for themselves through imposing constraints [constitutive rules]. The dedicated puzzle solver will say, \"Don't tell me the answer; let me work it out for myself.\" Even if other means for coming to know the answer are readily available, he voluntarily rejects these means so that he will have something to do. This is definition of game playing.\n\nWhereas our own culture is based on various kinds of scarcity -- economic, moral, scientific, erotic -- the culture of Utopia will be based on plentitude and abundance. A utopic society would not study economics but rather [agalmics](thoughts/positive%20sum.md).\n\n## Games\nDefinitions:\n1. \"Let us say that games are goal-directed activities in which inefficient means are intentionally chosen.\"\n2. \"A game is an activity in which observance of rules is part of the end of the activity, and where such rules are non-ultimate; that is, where other rules can always supersede. the game rules; that is, where the player can always stop playing the game\"\n\nThen, to play a game is to attempt to achieve a specific state of affairs [prelusory goals], using only means permitted by rules [lusory means], where the rules prohibit the use of more efficient in favour of less efficient means [constitutive rules], and where the rules are accepted just because they make possible such activity possible [lusory attitude] (this is to say that rules are sufficient to make possible a game but not required). Simplified, **playing a game is the voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles.**\n\n\"Rules in games thus seem to be in some sense inseparable from ends, for to break a game rule (a means) is to render impossible the attainment of an end.\"\n\n\"In anything but a game the gratuitous introduction of unnecessary obstacles to the achievement of an end is regarded as a decidedly irrational thing to do, whereas in games it appears to be an absolutely essential thing to do.\"\n\nGames which are competitive (read: telic) involve winning and losing -- that is the aim or end of the game in the first place. The win of one implies the loss of another, a [zero sum](thoughts/zero%20sum.md) world. Playing, though, are the means which are ends themselves; the act of playing is enough and paratelic in nature. Thus, someone who plays games as an end is autotelic.\n\n\u003e Do you like the act of climbing the mountain or just being at the top? Because the latter doesn't require the first.\n\nGames, simply put, reverse the ends and means of other activities. In Kant's *Critique of Aesthetic Judgment*, he likens aesthetic experience to play as a kind of 'purposiveness without purpose' \n\n### Open and Closed Games\n- **Open games**: system of reciprocally enabling moves whose purpose is the continued operation of the system.\n- **Closed games**: games which have an inherent goal whose achievement ends the game. e.g. crossing a finish line, mating a king, etc.\n\nDisagreement in games then, usually comes from the disagreement over whether a certain game is open or closed.\n\n\"We might expect societies which place a high value on success through co-operation to be more inclined to emphasize open games\"\n\n### Distinction between rules and goals\nIt is possible to follow the rules of chess [the institution] without playing chess [the game]. On the contrary, one cannot play chess without following the rules (to do so is to be a cheat).\n\n### Terminology\n- Prelusory goals: specific achievable state of affairs. They can be described before, or independently of, any game of which it may be, or come to be, a part.\n- Lusory goals: winning the game. Game specific.\n- Lusory means: means which are permitted (legal or legitimate) in the attempt to achieve prelusory goals.\n- Constitutive rules: rules which prohibit use of the most efficient means for reaching a prelusory goal.\n- Lusory attitude: the acceptance of constitutive rules just so the activity made possible by such acceptance can occur.\n\n### Lusory Attitude -- the game attitude\nThe element which unifies the other elements into a single formula which successfully states the necessary and sufficient conditions for any activity to be an instance of game playing. The elements of game are\n1. The goal\n2. The means of achieving the goal\n3. The rules\n4. The lusory attitude\n",

Creation: \"focus on finding new places and ways to use technologies and new insights that AI might yield when ML is applied to massive datasets to find relationships in the data\"\n2. Maintenance: \"surfaces problems with existing systems and attempts to mitigate those harms (for instance, by making them more fair, accountable, and transparent)\"\n\n\"When designers of these algorithmic systems train computational models that ignore transgender identity, these systems demand that trans people somehow shed an identity they can't; identities that cisgender people hardly ever bother to regard.\"\n\n\"Designers of sociotechnical systems have repeatedly built computational systems and models rendering decisions that exacerbate and reinforce historical prejudices, oppression, and marginalization\"\n\nFor those of us who can just *not* deal with race, or gender, or sexuality, we get to pass through these systems relatively unscathed. But for those of us who can't ignore those dimensions of who we are, those aspects of ourselves make us stick out. More examples in [Design Justice](thoughts/Design%20Justice.md).\n\n## [Utopia](thoughts/utopia.md)\nA utopia implies perfection and thus no feedback. ML models think they live in a perfect world unless told otherwise.\n\nRelated: [The ones who walk away from Omelas](thoughts/The%20ones%20who%20walk%20away%20from%20Omelas.md)\n\n## '[Truth](thoughts/truth.md)' and [Feedback loops](thoughts/feedback%20loops.md)\n\"Absurdity follows when algorithmic systems deny the people they mistreat the status to lodge complaints, let alone the power to repair, resist, or escape the world that these systems create.\" How do [feedback loops](thoughts/feedback%20loops.md) play into these systems? Is it possible to create good human-in-the-loop ML?\n\n\"Absurdity and tragedy tend to manifest when bureaucratic imaginations diverge from reality and when people can't override the delusions baked into those imaginations\" It's dangerous when a single source dictates the truth.\n\nBut when the institution *does* wield power and people can't just leave anymore, these institutions can (and do) get more and more detached from the lives and needs of people. Those bureaucracies construct their own worlds where everything gets \"rationalized\" in simplified, reductive language.\n\n\"People talk about \"debiasing\" data and reviewing code before a model is trained and deployed. What I'm saying is that even if you've done everything right, if you don't pay attention to the power dynamics as they unfold and play out, the system out in the world is going to drift further and further away from reality.\"\n\nSystemized classification and quantification of the world acts as an interpretive and transformational force. In other words, [quantization](thoughts/quantization.md) changes the world.\n\nWhy monopolies (over data and power) are bad: bureaucracies with no power self-correct (or be corrected) -\u003e they have no place in a world where people can freely walk away or reject the bureaucracy's nonsense (give feedback)\n\n## Abridged Maps\nAbridged maps as [potemkin villages](thoughts/potemkin%20village.md), producing a simplified yet inaccurate view of the world. It's not necessarily wrong to create 'abridged maps', the problem comes when projecting the map onto the world to try and create change.\n\n\"When modelers and designers of influential systems use these maps as guides to substantially transform the world, the abridgements and the omissions they make become targets of erasure.\"\n\n\"In the process of training a model, the algorithm creates its own world -- it generates its own sort of utopia where things are clear and calculable. That system imposes its model upon the world, judging and punishing people who don't fit the model that the algorithm produced in the interest of some ostensibily objective goal that designers insist is better than decisions humans make in some or many ways.\"\n\nThese systems become more actively dangerous when they go from \"making sense of the world\" to \"making the world make sense\"\n\nThere's no dataset in the world that adequately conveys white supremacy, or slavery, or colonialism. (see: [data distributions](thoughts/data%20distributions.md))\n\nSo at best these systems generate a facsimile of a world with the shadows of history cast on the ground skewed, flattened, and always lacking depth that only living these experiences can bring.

    "title": "Trust as Unquestioning Attitude",
    "content": "\nPHIL240A Essay 1\n\nExplain how Nguyen's account of trust as an unquestioning attitude entails that we integrate objects into our own agency.\n\nA good answer to this question will include an explanation of what it means for trust to be an unquestioning attitude, a clarification of why we trust objects given this account, and a statement of what it means to integrate objects into our own agency.\n\n---\n\nNguyen's theory of the form of trust is the unquestioning attitude. Let us break down this meaning-laden phrase.\n\nUnquestioning implies an absence of \"deliberation over [something's] reliability\". To trust unquestioningly is to accept it as a basic axiom of your world and to take it for granted. It is invisible until it is gone or reconsidered.\n\nAttitude implies some semblance of consistent mental state or stability. Trust, then, as an attitude, must exhibit \"cognitive inertia\". To rephrase, this means that trust is more easily maintained than reconsidered.\n\nThis account, unlike the goodwill and responsiveness theories, does not presume intentionality or agent-directedness. In fact, by this account, any object can be trusted and thus be integrated into our own agency.\n\nTo integrate an object into our agency involves not just a reliance but an almost blind trust of that object to be load-bearing in our lives. This is clearly obvious with our readiness to extend smartphones and search engines into our lives which we do not fully understand as parts of our cognition.\n\nWe then turn to Clark and Chalmer's Extended Mind Hypothesis. Specifically, the parity principle: if an external resource plays the same functional role in supporting action as an action-supporting internal resource that is uncontroversially cognitive, then the external resource is part of the cognitive system of the agent.\n\nOne trusts their digital photo albums like they would their own memory -- often treating it like a part of our extended mind. When we lose our saved photos, it almost feels as if we've lost a part of our experience. When this object fails to function in an expected way, we not only feel disappointed but betrayed. To lose trust then, is to shift from the unquestioning state to the endlessly skeptical and suspicious mood.\n\nFootnote: It is interesting to consider differences between what we are trusting when we trust designed objects (e.g. search engines, devices, websites, etc.) versus non-designed objects (the ground, physics, etc.). I'm curious if there are properties of derived trust especially in regards to trusting the object really being a trust in its designer (trusting the engineers at Apple versus the iPhone itself). Does this have relation to non-designed objects like the Earth? Does this lead to the religious attempts to describe everything to ever exist as designed by God?",

Mostly the result of the Cold War and the military-industrial complex and the power of Stanford -- these two were not completely separate.\n\nA lot of military funding went to the west (and to California and thus Stanford). Big result of Fred Terman (Dean of Engineering at the time): \"let’s remake Stanford so that it’s a perfect receptacle for this new money. We are a true Cold War university.\"\n\nThe military-industrial complex rose as a result of the Cold War, showing how a capitalist democracy can be 'triumphant' over more socialist policies. As a result, a lot of government money went to private defense contractors (think Lockheed). When the Space Race came along, a lot of that money went to places specializing in small, light, powerful devices (microchips, integrated circuirts), and this happened to be Silicon Valley.\n\nGovernment wasn't the sole reason this explosion happened, rather more of \"a customer, as a catalyst, as a kind of de facto venture capitalist at an early stage, when there was no commercial market for this stuff.\"\n\n\u003e To have such mobilization around this massive effort, you do probably need some sort of geopolitical catalyst. It’s hard for it to be purely commercial...  **That’s the thing that can catalyze people, government, and resources into doing these big things.**\n\nProblem is that this 'urgency' needs to be bipartisan -- this was very difficult when the Soviet Union was widely feared. As a result, anything even mildly centrist is perceived as socialist -\u003e https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULYWIDcUOY4\n\nAbstraction of the problem\n\nAntipathy that the Valley has had towards the government is kind of like, \"Well it doesn’t have anything to do with us, if they could stay as far away as possible it would be good.\" -- tech is political\n\n## Democratic Capitalism\nDemocratic capitalism and the ability for people to protest what their government is doing.\n\nHistorically, white-collar tech workers in industry have been very OK with whatever their companies are doing as long is it gives them a comfy lifestyle -- yet now people are starting to question it.\n\nSo much of the technical expertise that used to be distributed across industry and government is now just in industry. This inbalance means that government agencies like the Pentagon and CIA need to go to these big tech companies to build good tech.\n\n## Blue-sky Operations\n\"Spending money on moonshots, whether metaphorical or real, is kind of something only the government can do.\"\n\nExamples like DARPA, investing in technology that is at least a few decades away from being commercializable or being something the military could possibly use.\n\nPersonal Computing? Moving away from establishments having all the computing power and giving power back to the individual user. \"We’re going to create these devices, take them, and build computers of our own that are apart from this corporate military-industrial business.\"\n\nTo tell a company that is accountable to shareholders and quarterly earnings calls, “Okay, the moonshot’s on you guys,” is not so great.\n\n### Sandbox Model\n\"Throw a lot of money in its direction and get out of the way\" Create the sandbox, an incredible container with lots of resources in it, and allow creative people to play around in the sand and see what they develop. Naturally very incompatible with political traditions in other places.\n\n### Moonshot People and Immigration\nPeople like Andy Grove who later becomes the CEO of Intel, come into the country as teenage refugees from places like Hungary where the immigration officers probably thought he would be a 'drain on the system'.\n\nBut then you have winners of one generation picking the winners of the next, creating a very self-reinforcing [feedback loop](thoughts/feedback%20loops.md). This as a result causes huge [diversity problems](thoughts/Design%20Justice.md) where it works really well for elite college students in the US but less so for the housewives in Myanmar.\n\n",

    "title": "Valve Handbook",
    "content": "\n[Source](https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/apps/valve/Valve_NewEmployeeHandbook.pdf)\n\nValve is a company is one that I respect a lot for the agency they give their employees. Feels very much like a [[thoughts/metalabel|metalabel]] where you have a bunch of highly agentic people working on things they wanna work on rather than a company.\n\nTLDR; hire well\n\n\u003e This book is an abbreviated encapsulation of our guiding principles. As Valve continues to grow, we hope that these principles will serve each new person joining our ranks.\n\nSome highlights from their handbook:\n\n## Facts that matter\n1. Valve is self-funded: gives agency to the org to work on work they care about and that customers care about\n2. Valve owns all of their IP: agency to make their own decisions about what they do with their products\n\n## Hierarchy\nFlatness necessarily implies high responsibility for the individual\n\nAdding individuals then (hiring), is one of the most important things people have control over at the company:\n\n\u003e \"If you’re thinking to yourself, “Wow, that sounds like a lot of responsibility,” you’re right. And that’s why hiring is the single most important thing you will ever do at Valve\"\n\nFlatness also means more mobility. *Why does your desk have wheels? Think of those wheels as a symbolic reminder that you should always be considering where you could move yourself to be more valuable.*\n\nPeople move frequently; there is no organizational structure keeping you from being in close proximity to the people who you'd help or be helped by most\n\n## Projects\nFlatness implies anyone has the power to green-light projects. So how does Valve choose what projects to prioritize?\n\n1. Employees vote on projects with their feet (or desk wheels)\n2. Strong projects are ones in which people can see demonstrated value; they staff up easily.\n\nHow should I as an individual choose what to work on? A few good guiding questions:\n1. Of all the projects currently under way, what’s the most valuable thing I can be working on?\n2. Which project will have the highest direct impact on our customers? How much will the work I ship benefit them?\n3. Is Valve not doing something that it should be doing?\n4. What’s interesting? What’s rewarding? What leverages my individual strengths the most?\n\nHow do people discover new projects? There is no central 'board', but the best way to find out about projects is to just ask people. \n\n\u003e Lots of people at Valve want and need to know what you care about, what you’re good at, what you’re worried about, what you’ve got experience with, and so on. And the way to get the word out is to start telling people all of those things.\n\nPeople first [[thoughts/friction|friction-ful]] onboarding!\n\n\n### Structure\n1. Team leads\n\t1. This person’s role is not a traditional managerial one. Most often, they’re primarily a clearinghouse of information.\n\t2. They’re keeping the whole project in their head at once so that people can use them as a resource to check decisions against. The leads serve the team, while acting as centers for the teams.\n2. There is still structure\n\t1. Project teams often have an internal structure that forms temporarily to suit the group’s needs.\n\t2. This is dynamic on scales of months to years, but gives some semblance of expectation and stability on the day-to-day.\n3. Hours\n\t1. For the most part working overtime for extended periods indicates a fundamental failure in planning or communication. If this happens at Valve, it’s a sign that something needs to be reevaluated and corrected (of course, there are exceptions like when a project nears ship date)\n\n## Long-term thinking\n\u003e If we’re not careful, these traits can cause us to race back and forth between short-term opportunities and threats, being responsive rather than proactive. So our lack of a traditional structure comes with an important responsibility. It’s up to all of us to spend effort focusing on what we think the long-term goals of the com- pany should be.\n\n1. Someone told me to (or not to) work on X. And they’ve been here a long time!\n\t1. They aren't always right! *Hold on to your goals if you’re convinced they’re correct. Check your assumptions. Pull more people in. Listen. Don’t believe that anyone holds authority over the decision you’re trying to make.*\n2. I constantly feel behind with everything going on! How do I make my work feel sustainable?\n\t1. Trust us, this is normal. Nobody expects you to devote time to every opportunity that comes your way. Instead, we want you to learn how to choose the most important work to do.\n3. How does Valve as an organization decide what to work on?\n\t1. We believe in each other to make these decisions, and this faith has proven to be well-founded over and over again.\n\t2. We have learned that when we take nearly any action, it’s best to do so in a way that we can measure, predict outcomes, and analyze results.\n4. Can I be involved with X?\n\t1. Yes. You either\n\t\t1. Start working on it\n\t\t2. Start talking to all the people who you think might be working on it already and find out how to best be valuable\n\n## Risk\nProviding the freedom to fail is an important trait of the company— we couldn’t expect so much of individuals if we also penal- ized people for errors.\n\nThere are still some bad ways to fail.\n- Repeating the same mistake over and over is one.\n- Not listening to customers or peers before or after a failure is another.\n- Never ignore the evidence; particularly when it says you’re wrong.\n\n### Collective Risk\nWhen everyone is sharing the steering wheel, it seems natural to fear that one of us is going to veer Valve’s car off the road.\n\n\u003e Concepts discussed in this book sound like they might work well at a tiny start-up, but not at a hundreds-of-people-plus- billions-in-revenue company. The big question is: Does all this stuff scale?\n\nWell, so far, yes. And we believe that if we’re careful, it will work better and better the larger we get. This might seem counterintuitive, but it’s a direct consequence of hiring great, accomplished, capable people.\n\n## Hiring\nIn the mean- time, here are some questions we always ask ourselves when evaluating candidates:\n\n- Would I want this person to be my boss?  \n- Would I learn a significant amount from them?\n- What if this person went to work for our competition?\n\nWe want people who are integral to *high-bandwidth collaboration*. People who can\n- deconstruct problems on the fly\n- talk to others as they do so\n- simultaneously being inventive, iterative, creative, talkative, and reactive\n\n### T-Shaped People\nWe care about T-shaped people: people who are both generalists (highly skilled at  \na broad set of valuable things—the top of the T) and also experts (among the best in their field within a narrow discipline—the vertical leg of the T).\n\nAn expert who is too narrow has difficulty collaborating. A generalist who doesn’t go deep enough in a single area ends up on the margins, not really contributing as an individual.\n\n## Things to improve\nThings Valve wishes they were better at\n\n1. Helping new people find their way\n2. Mentoring people\n3. Disseminating information internally\n4. Finding and hiring people in completely new disciplines\n5. Making predictions longer than a few months out\n6. We miss out on hiring talented people who prefer to work within a more traditional structure (isn’t something we should change, but it’s worth recognizing as a self-imposed limitation)",

The [Hacker](thoughts/Hackers.md): pushes the boundaries of the World, using exploration and 'meaningless' [play](thoughts/play.md)\n\t- The Hacker’s job is to experiment, to play, and to create “New” art. Why? Because they can.\n4. The Emissary: serves the World by ensuring its continuation\n\t- “A world wants to emerge as an infinite game: one that keeps on going, invites new agents to keep it in play, is fertile with surprises, and continues to generate unexpected meanings”\n\nCrucially, each of these masks are worn by a single person: the Artist\n\n\u003e “It requires the Artist to abandon any sense of a coherent self and take on a different kind of psychology. One that moves between the artistic masks that already exist unevenly inside us, letting each contribute to the creation of a World.”\n\n\n\n## World Seed\n-  the world seed\n\t-  \"It is made so that the created new worlds do not require one large server, but can run on multiple smaller servers.\"\n\t-  \"All [games](thoughts/games.md) using The Seed as their game engine allow conversion of one account in a Seed-based world to another.\n-  infrastructure that operates at different [pace layers](thoughts/pace%20layers.md)",

Arising out of the scale of machine learning algorithms\n\nClaim: transparency will not provide solutions to opacity, and therefore having more transparent algorithms is not a guarantee for better explanations, predictions, and overall justification of our trust in the results of an algorithm\n\nComputational reliabilism (CR)\n- offers epistemic justification for the belief that the algorithm is reliable and its results are trustworthy\n- main claim: researchers are justified in believing the results of AI systems because there is a reliable process that yields, most of the time, trustworthy results. \n- formal definition \"the probability that the next set of results of a reliable (AI system) is trustworthy is greater than the probability that the next set of results is trustworthy given that the first set was produced by an unreliable process by mere luck\"\n\t- in regular language: given two results are the same, we should consider the one generated by a reliable system to be more trustworthy\n- reliability indicators\n\t1. verification and validation methods: building and measuring dev confidence in the computer system. Verification is assessment of accuracy with comparison to known solutions, validation is the assessment of accuracy with comparison to experimental data\n\t2. robustness analysis: figure out whether results of a given model are an artefact of the model or related to the core features of the model\n\t3. a history of (un)successful implementations: scientific and engineering methodologies and practices related to designing, coding, and running algorithms\n\t4. expert knowledge: experts' judgements, evaluations, and sanctioning\n\nResponsibility gaps\n- a physician cannot be held responsible for results of algorithms they don't understand\n\t- though, we do generally accept ex-post explanations and deem these sufficient of human actors in decision making\n\t- physicians typically operate other technologies and machinery which they do not fully understand or cannot fully explain the inner working of (e.g. MRI scans)\n\t\t- Debatable; because they are not making decisions, just presenting information. Additionally, these other technologies generally *can* be understood by an expert. This is not the case for AI systems\n\nCounterpoints raised:\n- automation complacency: tendency to overestimate the reliability of decision support systems\n- black box algorithms can hide normative assumptions\n\t- epistemic and normative considerations often blur into each other in the medical setting\n\t- we know nothing about the priors of the black box algorithm\n- model and data drift\n\t- computationally reliable black box algorithms can be reliable in one setting and time and not everywhere and forever",

Can be used to build cryptocurrencies like [Bitcoin](thoughts/bitcoin.md), [[thoughts/Solana|Solana]], and [Ethereum](thoughts/ethereum.md).\n\nLike symbolic systems, meaning needs to be derived through [intentionality](thoughts/intentionality.md). Run into problems of agreement on meaning of symbols and the [Degraded Blockchain problem](thoughts/Degraded%20Blockchain%20problem.md)\n\nCharacteristics:\n1. Distributed: data is stored by and updates are broadcasted to everyone\n2. Smart Contracts: codified agreements. Once the predetermined conditions of the contract are met, the transaction and attached computation are completed and recorded on the blockchain.\n3. Immutable: A completed transaction can never be changed or hidden. This gives us **provenance of assets** (you can determine any asset's entire history as long as all transactions happen on-chain)\n4. [Decentralized](thoughts/decentralization.md): communal consensus rather than one party's decisions determines access/update to the chain\n\nOn a technical level, blockchain is just a distributed linked list.\n\nEach block contains the hash of the previous block header and the [Merkle root](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merkle-tree.asp) representing the hash of all the transactions in that block.\n\nTransactions happen as follows:\n1. A transaction is initiated\n2. Data is packaged into a bolck\n3. Block is sent to members of the chain\n4. Consensus and approval by rest of network (either [proof of work](thoughts/proof%20of%20work.md) or [proof of stake](thoughts/proof%20of%20stake.md))\n5. Block is added to chain\n6. Chain update is distributed to members\n\n## Why it Matters\nIt feels like the level of change which blockchain impacts is huge but at the same time latent.\n\nAfter going through a bunch of Kernel modules, Austin came upon a name for the concept: \"blockchain changes what soil is\"\n\n\"The \"new world\" seems to look very similar to the old. i.e. *isn't a DAO just voting on how to donate money, which we could do today?*\"\n\nIn actuality, the *layer* at which change is happening is much deeper (more [infrastructure](thoughts/infrastructure.md) level than solution/product level)\n\n## Permanence\nAlso just leans heavily in the direction of [digital permanence](thoughts/digital%20permanence.md)\n\n## Data\n[Source: Ethereal Dreamers by *Kernel*](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-1/promise-blockchains)\n\n\"Back in early history, the databases were singular, existing in an atomic state with one DB per enterprise. The network existed in some relational sense between enterprises, but because DB's were so fragile they never spoke directly to the network because then they broke. Even if you did connect DBs somewhat directly, the DB encodes the worldview of the organization and different organizations have different worldviews, so the DBs can't speak to each other clearly.\"\n\n**There were no large-scale computer-to-computer connections that allowed us to create a shared world view between lots of different organizations**.\n\n\u003e This is the promise of blockchains -- to create a global 'distributed database'\n\nThe goal is to build a single, shared story of reality, spread across all the machines simultaneously. And when it changes in one place, it changes everywhere.\n\n### Thoughts\nThe part about no more 'storing stuff' and 'sending stuff' I always find interesting because 'storing' stuff still happens to be on the public ledger. The only difference now is that there is a distinction between sending metadata (which you tell someone to just refer to a piece of data on chain) and sending information (transferring ownership).\n\nWaiting for the day web3 projects get large enough to amortize and offset the gas fees that consumers pay now (much like centralized orgs nowadays front hosting costs for 'free' tier or the average consumer).\n\n### Act II -- Smart Contracts\n\"First we merged the network and the database in a blockchain. Then, we take computer software and put it into the shared database. That means everyone that is connected has a copy of exactly the same program: same data, same code, same result\"\n\n### Act III --- IOT\nThe 'scaled blockchain'\n\nIdeally we get to a point where we have a 'global computing service' (very Asiimov's Last Question-esque) through which we can embed IOT devices. This would turn all the sensors and bits of computing power into a global unified knowledge resources that manages the infrastructure of our society\n\nI'm curious how this relates to [truth](thoughts/truth.md), specifically how different people have different views on 'reality' and 'truth'. How do we reconcile that at a global scale?",

They either\n1. don't offset the amount they were supposed to do\n2. bought gains that were quickly offset\n3. amount of carbon couldn't be measured accurately\n\nUltimately leading polluters to get off scott-free while the planet still suffers. Is this still ok thought? As long as some trees are saved and foreign aid is going toward protecting forests\n\nCarbon offsets are just \"charismatic carbon\" -- they offer a feel-good story of environmental and social good without doing much\n\nOriginally was a compromise between European, American, and developing nations\n1. European leaders wanted to create policies to encourage industry to pollute less\n2. Americans wanted flexibility\n3. Developing nations (e.g. Brazil) wanted money to deal with climate change\n\nOn paper, this seemed perfect: if it cost too much to reduce emissions in one area, you could 'buy' the equivalent offset. This in theory could incentivize orgs to try and develop more green tech (e.g. solar plant in favour of a coal plant) in anticipation of carbon credit sales\n\nIn practice doesn't work super well\n1. Clean Development Mechanism: 85% of offsets had a 'low likelihood' of creating real impacts\n2. Join Implementation: 75%\n\nLeakage: protecting one patch of land could lead to deforestation somewhere else as loggers work to try and meet quotas\n\nPreserving land and trees is hard in any developing country is hard: the poverty and lack of infrastructure \"drives people to violate whatever protections are in place to plant crops or mine for gold or just have enough lumber to build their homes\"\n\n\u003e When a tree is destroyed, all the carbon accumulated over its lifetime is released back into the atmosphere.\n\nBut there's not a lot of incentive for local residents\n- Rubber sells for about 2 reais/kg (roughly enough for a cup of coffee) whereas a single cow is ~800 reais ($200)\n- Sustainable logging didn't pay enough\n- Government subsidies don't consider enough things\n\t- Digging fish ponds but they don't produce enough\n\t- Rubber-tapping tries but can't afford fertilizer for the poor Amazon soil\n\n\u003e “Cattle is a secure market. You can get a good income selling a calf, an ox,” Silva said.\n\n\u003e “Who is willing to rubber tap nowadays?” Brito said. “Nobody, practically nobody. We want an easier way to live.”\n\nGerrymandering but for trees? A lot of the offset calculations are based off of regional averages for carbon, projects can then take advantage of 'unusually high' concentration areas with certain types of trees to game the system and gain more credits than they should have.\n\nThis could actually benefit indigenous tribes because of their more conservative approach to logging -- in fact, offsets can enable tribes to reduce logging. However, \"some tribal members are [deeply uncomfortable](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/how-carbon-trading-became-a-way-of-life-for-californias-yurok-tribe) with the idea of selling offsets to companies like this even if they are legitimate, fearing they’re effectively profiting from pollution.\"\n\n### Good Offsets?\n[Source: Buying Offsets](https://negative.sanctuary.computer/offsetting)\n\n1. Transparency: any individual credits can not be purchased more than once\n2. Permanence: credits should not be liable to be undone\n3.

    "content": "\nMeasuring time in the context of computer systems\n\n## Physical Time\nTwo types of clock\n1. Physical clock: number of seconds elapsed\n2. Logical clock: count events, e.g. messages sent\n\nTime is hard! So many different ways of measuring time\n- Greenwich Mean Time (GMT): the normal human time format, based on Earth rotation\n- International Atomic Time (TAI): some multiple of Caesium-133 resonant frequency\n- Compromise, UTC is TAI with corrections to account for Earth rotation\n- Unix Time: number of seconds since the epoch (Jan 1, 1970) not counting leap seconds\n- ISO8601: year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and timezone offset relative to UTC\n\nPeriodically adjust local clock with a server with a more accurate time source using Network Time Protocol (NTP) or Precision Time Protocol (PTP)\n\nHow do we estimate time over a network?\n- NTP Client sends out a request at $t_1$\n- NTP Server receives request at $t_2$\n- NTP Server sends a response at $t_3$\n- NTP Client receives a request at $t_4$\n- Round-trip network delay = $\\delta = (t_4-t_1) - (t_3-t_2)$\n- **Estimated** single-trip network delay = $\\delta / 2$\n- Estimated server time when client receives response, so clock skew is $\\theta = (t_3 + \\delta / 2) - t_4$\n- If $\\theta \u003c 125ms$, slew the clock: speed it up/slow it down by 500ppm until clocks are in sync\n- If $125ms \\leq \\theta \u003c 1000s$, step the clock: suddenly reset client clock to estimated server timestamp\n- If $\\theta \\geq 1000s$, panic and do nothing (leave it to the humans!)\n\n## Logical Time\nProblem is that *even with synced clocks* we can have $t_2 \u003c t_1$ with a message A at $t_1$ with a response B at $t_2$. Here, the timestamp order is inconsistent with expected order! This can happen when the clock skew is *less* than the one way network latency.\n\nSo we use logical clocks to work based off of *the number of events that have occurred rather than actual time passed.*\n\n### Lamport Clocks\n\nLogic\n- On initialization, set `t := 0` for each node\n- On any event on local node, `fn tick() -\u003e t += 1`\n- On sending message $m$, `fn send(m) -\u003e tick(); actually_send(t, m)`\n- On receiving `fn receive(t', m) -\u003e t = max(t, t') + 1; do_something(m)`\n\nProperties\n- If $a \\rightarrow b$ then $L(a) \u003c L(b)$\n- However, $L(a) \u003c L(b)$ does not imply $a \\rightarrow b$\n- Possible that $L(a) = L(b)$ for $a \\neq b$\n\nThis means that two identical Lamport timestamps might not correspond to the same unique event. However if we include the node $N(e)$ for the node where event $e$ occurred, then $(L(e), N(e))$ **uniquely identifies** event $e$.\n\nWe attempt to define a total [[thoughts/causality|causal]] order\n\n$$(a \\prec b) \\iff (L(a) \u003c L(b)) \\lor (L(a) = L(b) \\land N(a) \u003c N(b))$$\n\nHowever even now, given timestamps $L(a) \u003c L(b)$, we can't tell whether $a \\rightarrow b$ or $a \\parallel b$\n\nTo separate [[thoughts/causality|causality]] from concurrent events, we need vector clocks!\n\n### Vector Clocks\nInstead of having a single counter `t` for all nodes, we keep a vector timestamp $a$ of an event for *each* node so we have $V(a) = \\langle t_1, t_2, \\ldots, t_n \\rangle$ where $t_i$ is the number of events observed by node $N_i$\n\nEach node has a current vector timestamp $T$, on an event on node $N_i$, increment vector element $T[i]$\n\nLogic\n- On initialization , set `t := [0] * n`\n- On any event on node $N_i$, `fn tick() -\u003e t[i] += 1`\n- On sending message $m$ from node $N_i$, `fn send(m) -\u003e tick(); actually_send(t, m)`\n- On receiving `fn receive(t', m) -\u003e t = zip(t, t').map(max); tick(); do_something(m)`\n\nThus, a vector timestamp of an event $e$ actually represents all of its *[[thoughts/message ordering|causal]] dependencies*: $\\{ e \\} \\cup \\{a | a \\rightarrow e \\}$\n\nE.g. $\\langle 2, 2, 0 \\rangle$ represents first two events from $N_1$, first two events from $N_2$, and no events from $N_3$\n\nOrdering\n- $T= T' \\iff T[i] = T'[i] \\ \\forall i \\in \\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$ (T and T' are same if each element has the same value)\n- $T \\leq T' \\iff T[i] \\leq T'[i] \\ \\forall i \\in \\{1, \\cdots, n\\}$ (T happened at the same time or earlier than T' if each element in T is less than or equal to its value in T')\n- $T \u003c T' \\iff T \\leq T' \\land T \\neq T'$ (T happened earlier than T' if each element in T is less than its value in T', at least one element in T differs from T')\n\t- $T \\parallel T' \\iff T \\nleq T' \\land T' \\nleq T$ (T is incomparable to T')\n\nProperties\n- $V(a) \\leq V(b) \\iff (\\{a\\} \\cup \\{e | e \\rightarrow a\\}) \\subseteq (\\{b\\} \\cup \\{e | e \\rightarrow b\\})$\n- $V(a) \u003c V(b) \\iff (a \\rightarrow b)$\n- $V(a) = V(b) \\iff (a = b)$\n- $V(a) \\parallel V(b) \\iff a \\parallel b$",

Or is it something else entirely (the ether or the soul)?\n\n\"Consciousness is always consciousness of something, and when the object is subtracted, nothing remains to be characterized\" (cannot be of independent origin, [emptiness](thoughts/emptiness.md))\n\nSee also: [Hard problem of consciousness](thoughts/Hard%20problem%20of%20consciousness.md), [Buddhism](thoughts/Buddhism.md), [The Upanisads](thoughts/The%20Upanisads.md), [qualia](thoughts/qualia.md), [self-knowledge](thoughts/self-knowledge.md), [[thoughts/Primary of Consciousness|Primary of Consciousness]], [[thoughts/Nagel's Bat Argument|Nagel's Bat Argument]]\n\nTypes of consciousness:\n- Phenomenal consciousness (felt consciousness) vs Access consciousness\n- Gross consciousness (obvious waking state) vs Subtle consciousness (sleep/deep sleep). In more Indian philosophy, consciousness is that which is luminous (revealing) and has capacity for cognition.\n\nTheories of consciousness\n- Cognitive Theories: consciousness is based in areas that are devoted to cognitive processing (thinking, reasoning, evaluating, memory, etc.)\n\t- Global workspace theory: consciousness arises from highly coordinated, widespread activity in the brain\n\t\t- When signals are broadcast to the global workspace, we become conscious of the sensation\n\t\t- When they remain localized, they are not perceived conscoiusly\n- Sensory Theories: consciousness is based in areas that are devoted to sensory processing\n\t- Block argues that recurrent processing in sensory areas is the NCC for phenomenally conscious perception\n\t- e.g. [Neural Correlates of Consciousness (NCC)](thoughts/Neural%20Correlates%20of%20Consciousness%20(NCC).md)\n- First-order theories: consciousness is a product of the cognitive processing of sensory information\n\t- e.g. [Integrated Information Theory of Consciousness (IIT)](thoughts/Integrated%20Information%20Theory%20of%20Consciousness%20(IIT).md)\n- Higher-order theories: consciousness involves something done to build on that cognitive representation of the sensory experience\n\t- e.g. [Stream of Consciousness](thoughts/Stream%20of%20Consciousness.md)\n\n## Minimal Phenomenal Experience[^1]\nSimplest form in which a state can be phenomenally conscious\n\nDreamless sleep experience is a candidate for this\n\nBackground [phenomenologies](thoughts/phenomenology.md) claim these experiences combine\n- minimal dimensionality (of awareness)\n- maximal prototypicality (overlap with other states/modes of awareness)\n\nIf we find a minimal form of phenomenal experience in all forms of phenomenal content and underlies all conscious experience, then this model would amount to solving the problem of consciousness as such\n\nProblems for interpreting reports of pure awareness in meditative experience\n1. Embodied theory contamination: background theoretical assumptions strongly condition personal beliefs and thus processing and reporting\n2. Conceptual consistency: how does one interpret words like \"perceive\", \"luminous\", \"radiant\" in reports of experiences that are supposed to be \"contentless\"\n3. Performative self-contradiction: \"I experienced a selfless state\" is a self-contradictory \n\n### Metzinger's 6D concept of MPE\n1. PC1 - Wakefulness: phenomenal quality of tonic alertness (intrinsic arousal and focus of attention)\n2. PC2 - Low Complexity: absence of high-level symbolic mental content, perceptual, sensorimotor, emotional content\n3. PC3 - Self-luminosity: the \"clear light\" of primordial awareness\n4. PC4 - Introspective Availability: can we introspect on our current mental state\n5. PC5 - Epistemicity: feeling of knowing or subjective quality of confidence (doesn't logically entail actual knowledge)\n6. PC6 - Transparency/Opacity: transparent means only intentional-content properties of the state can be introspected whereas opacity means properties of the carrier/vehicle of the state can also be introspected\n\n![](thoughts/images/6d%20MPE.png)\n\n### Ascending Reticular Activating System (ARAS)[^1]\nThis system determines the brain's general level of activation.\n\nPure awareness is experienced as \"contentless\" although it is actually a representation of ARAS\n\nThis model is [physicalist](thoughts/Materialism.md) (awareness-as-such is constituted by the brain) and representationalist (awareness-as-such is a neurally constituted representation of the brain's auto-activated wakefulness -- character is tonic alertness with a feeling of knowing)\n\n## Problems with information theories of consciousness\n[Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2014.00225/full)\n\nTwo main camps\n1. Radical behaviourists: all talk of the mind could be translated, without scientific loss, into talk about behaviour\n2. Cognitivists: all talk of the mind (including consciousness) could translated, without scientific loss, into talk about information processing\n\n### Cognitivists\nTheories that equate consciousness with information or information processing are dualist in nature\n\nChalmers (in The Conscious Mind: in Search of a Fundamental Theory) defines information in the actual world as having two aspects\n1. Physical\n2. Phenomenal\n\nHowever, [information](thoughts/information.md) is usually defined at odds to this\n1. Information is often used to refer to non-mental, user-independent, declarative semantic contents, embedded *in* physical implementations (Floridi, 2005)\n\t1. Important distinction: Physical things encode and embed information but themselves are not information\n\t2. James Joyce's copy of Dante's Inferno may _carry_ information, but it is not itself information—it's just an arrangement of paper and ink\n\t3. Your brain when he looks at an octopus may encode information, but it is not itself information\n2. An objective (mind-independent) entity... information can be encoded and transmitted, but the information would exist independently of its encoding or transmission\n\nSeriality problem\n- While the brain works as a parallel distributed network with virtually unlimited resources, conscoius events appear consecutive and momentary capacity is strongly limited. Multi-tasking is notoriously hard. Theories regarding consciousness as a particular case of brain information processing must suggest a specific mechanism for creating serial processes from a collection of parallel ones\n- Not a problem for behaviour-based theories as behaviour is a series of agent-environment interactions. Attention budget, more complex behaviours take more bandwidth and thus require more focus (need to be done in serial). Things can be trained to reduce focus needed (e.g. walking and talking)\n\nProblematic: thermostats (for example) clearly carry information, but are not widely regarded as having any degree of consciousness\n\nChalmers has two options:\n1. Perhaps only some kinds of “physically realized information spaces” are conscious.\n2. Perhaps thermostats are conscious (option that Chalmers chose). Suggests that \"the level of organization at which consciousness “winks out” might be lower than a thermostat but higher than a rock.\"\n\nTononi's [Integrated Information Theory of Consciousness (IIT)](thoughts/Integrated%20Information%20Theory%20of%20Consciousness%20(IIT).md)\n- Resolution to this problem is choosing that only *integrated* information is conscious\n- IIT does not even answer this question directly, only correlating the two and correlation is most definitely neither definition nor causation: \"To recapitulate, the theory claims that consciousness _corresponds to_ the capacity to integrate information\"\n\n### Behaviourist approaches\n[Boris Kotchoubey in Frontiers in Psychology](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00567/full)\n\nHuman consciousness emerges on the interface between three components of animal behaviour:\n1. Communication\n2. Play\n3. Use of tools\n\nBehaviour, in this context, is a biological adjustment by means of movements and all kinds of movement-related physiological activity\n\nCommunication and play yields symbolic games and, more importantly, language\n\nInteraction between symbols and tools results in human [praxis](thoughts/praxis.md)\n\nLife is a continuous battle against the second law of thermodynamics. All organisms' needs can be subsumed as a need in negentropy\n\n1. [Play](thoughts/play.md): Play, therefore, introduces something that can be called “second reality” (Vygotsky, 1978). In this reality the life is going on as if it is the “primary reality,” but with the nice difference that whenever I don't like what happens, I simply stop the process and go out, or start it anew. This makes play suspiciously like consciousness\n2. Tools: A stick is eventually manipulated “just for fun,” and then, suddenly, it turns out to be useful. Thus no animals unable to play can use tools.\n3. Communication: behaviour whose main effect is changing the behaviour of another animal\n\n![](thoughts/images/Sources%20of%20consciousness.png)\n\nConsciousness is then the simulated or [potemkin village](thoughts/potemkin%20village.md) of reality. In words of Karl Popper, instead of dying as a result of our errors, we can let our hypotheses die on our site ([Popper, 1963](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00567/full#B143)).\n\nWe do not consciously think (construct this virtual reality) all the time. Consciousness is the *capacity* to consciously think ([telerobotics](thoughts/telerobotics.md) vs telepresence)\n\nEssay 2 for PHIL451A: [Consciousness is not Information](thoughts/Consciousness%20is%20not%20Information.md)\n\n[^1]: This content is sourced from Professor [Evan Thompson](https://evanthompson.me/)'s course materials for PHIL451A at UBC.

This [fault tolerance](thoughts/fault%20tolerance.md) against 51% attacks is due to the fact that convincing the community that any engineered 'truth' is the real on requires subverting every trusted member in the community, most notably media and news sources (also why systems of authoritarian power are so scary). \n\nA difficult problem for [governance](thoughts/governance.md) within [communities](thoughts/communities.md)\n\n## Algorithmic Consensus\nThere are four requirements to such an algorithm:\n\n1. Validity. The result must be a value that was submitted by at least one of the processes. The consensus algorithm cannot just make up a value.\n2. Uniform agreement. All nodes must select the same value.\n3. Integrity. A node can select only a single value. That is, a node cannot announce one outcome and later change its mind.\n4. Termination. Also known as progress, every node must eventually reach a decision.\n\n## Consensus and Humming in the IETF\n[Source: IETF](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7282)\n\nOn rough consensus\n- Humming as 'temp checks' for people to voice disagreement but default assumption is optimistic trust\n- \"While counting heads might give a good guess as to what the rough consensus will be, doing so can allow important minority views to get lost in the noise. One of the strengths of a consensus model is that minority views are addressed, and using a rough consensus model should not take away from that.\"\n- \"We can't know who the \"members\" of any given working group would be at any one time, and we certainly can't know who all of the \"members\" of the IETF would be: That's why we refer to \"participants\" in the IETF; the IETF doesn't really have \"members\". Indeed, we often recruit additional implementers and other experts into working groups in order to ensure that broader views are brought into the discussion.

    "content": "\n## Definitions\n### ACID Consistency\nThe state satisfies application-specific invariants (e.g. every course with students enrolled must have at least one lecturer)\n\n### Replication Consistency\nMany models to choose from! Most common being read-after-write consistency\n\nImagine a scenario where\n- Client writes to servers A and B but request to A fails (so only B has correct state)\n- Client reads from servers A and B but request to B fails (so only client gets A's incorrect state)\n\nClearly, client is getting inconsistent results. We can fix this via a **[[thoughts/quorum|quorum]] read.**\n\n## Atomic Commitment Problem\nBig problem with distributed transactions: atomic commitment problem\n- Either all nodes must commit or all must abort\n- If any node crashes, all must abort\n\nUsually done through two-phase commit (2PC)\n- Client begins a transaction with database nodes A and B\n- When done, the client *commits* the transaction with the coordinator\n- Coordinator tells both A and B to prepare for the commit\n- If both A and B think it is fine for them to commit, then coordinator tells both to commit (A and B cannot go back on their response to prepare, if they said they are prepared for the commit they must commit when the coordinator tells them to)\n\nBut what if the coordinator crashes? The algorithm is blocked until coordinator recovers. We can use a fault-tolerant two-phase commit (uses [[thoughts/message broadcast#Total order broadcast|total order broadcast]])\n\n## Linearizability\nDefined as consistency in the face of concurrent reads/writes.\n\nInformally: every operation takes effect atomically sometime after it started and before it finished. All operations behave as if executed on a *single copy of the data*\n\nNot to be confused with serializability: transactions having the same effect as if they were run in some serial order. Also contrasting with [[thoughts/causality|causal]] relationships, linearizability is defined in terms of real-time whereas [[thoughts/causality|causal]] is defined in terms of message sending and receiving.\n\nThe consequence/desired property of linearizability is that every operation returns an \"up-to-date\" value, sometimes called \"strong consistency\"\n\nWe can guarantee linearizability of get (quorum read + read repair) and set (blind write to quorum). If events overlap, either order could happen and is ok.\n\nNot without downsides\n- Performance costs: lots of messages and waiting for responses\n- Scalability limits: leader can be a bottleneck\n- Availability problems: if you can't contact a quorum of nodes, you can't process any operations\n\n## Eventual Consistency\nAlternative to linearizability is eventual consistency.\n\nIf there are no more updates, **eventually** all replicas will be in the same state.\n\nBut how do we know when there are no more updates? This can be an indefinite amount of time. An upgraded version of this is strong eventual consistency which has a few additional rules:\n- Eventual delivery: every update made to one non-faulty replica is eventually processed by every non-faulty replica\n- Convergence: any two replicas that have processed the same set of updates are in the same state\n\nProperties\n- Does not require waiting for network communication\n- [[thoughts/causality|Causal]] broadcast can disseminate updates\n- Conflicts arising from concurrent updates need to be resolved\n\n## Summary\nSummary of minimum [[thoughts/system model|system model]] requirements for various forms of consistency\n\n|Problem|Must wait for communication|Requires synchrony|\n|--|--|--|\n|atomic commit|all participating nodes|partially synchronous|\n|consensus, total order broadcast|quorum|partially synchronous|\n|linearizable get/set|quorum|asynchronous|\n|eventual consistency, causal broadcast, FIFO broadcast|local replica only|asynchronous|\n",

And children learn language by first learning their own (\"baby-talk\") dialects. So, when we think of microworlds as incubators for powerful ideas, we are trying to draw upon this effective strategy: We allow learners to learn the \"official\" physics by allowing them the freedom to invent many that will work in as many invented worlds.\n\nWhy there is no good answer to \"how do I learn CS\" \n\"I see Piaget as the theorist of learning without curriculum and the theorist of the kind of learning that happens without deliberate teaching... But 'teaching without curriculum' does not mean spontaneous, free-form classrooms or simply 'leaving the child alone.' It means supporting children as they build their own intellectual structures with materials drawn from the surrounding culture\"\n\n\u003e \"They'll handle the details. Indeed, they insist on it. For a project to feel like your own, you must have sufficient autonomy. You can't be working to order, or slowed down by bureaucracy.\" -- [Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/own.html)\n\n## [Design Justice](thoughts/Design%20Justice.md)\nPedagogical approach that centers [context](thoughts/context.md), situated knowledge, and learning by doing.\n\nPapert rejected the banking method of education: educator transmits a piece of information to the learner's brain\n\nInstead, learning is *experiential*: it takes place through an active process where the learning develops the ability to modify or transform an object or idea.\n\nCore principles\n1. People do not get ideas, they make them\n2. People construct new knowledge with particular effectiveness when they are engaged in constructing personally meaningful products\n\n\"Instead, design justice pedagogies must support students to actively develop their own critical analysis of design, power, and liberation, in ways that connect with their own lived experience\"\n\nHowever, if resource constraints become an excuse to avoid examining the root of the problem area, then designers will almost always end up, at best, providing Band-Aids for deep wounds and, at word, actively serving existing power structures.",

They're _designed_ not to adapt; also budgeted and financed not to, constructed not to, administered not to, maintained not to, regulated and taxed not to, even remodelled not to.

For reliable systems, error handling is more work than the happy path. The same thing is true for large services -- all of this stuff that people don't think of as “real” work is more work than the core service\n\n## On shifting the focus too quickly\n\"One important topic of conversation is the danger of moving too triumphantly from innovation to maintenance. There is no point in keeping the practice of hero-worship that merely changes the cast of heroes without confronting some of the deeper problems underlying the innovation obsession.\"",

Logical Decentralization: are the data structures used to represent the system more monolithic or swarm-like? if you cut the system in half (both providers and users), will both halves continue to fully operate as independent units?\n\nNotes:\n* Architectural centralization often leads to political centralization (at least in the physical world, less true for digital spaces)\n\n## Centralization\n[Source: Why Decentralization Matters by *Chris Dixon*](https://onezero.medium.com/why-decentralization-matters-5e3f79f7638e)\n\nFollow a predictable life cycle along the S-shaped adoption curve.\n\nAt the beginning, will do everything they can to garner usage and appear more valuable as platforms with multi-sided positive network effects. However, when they move up the S-curve, their power grows. Eventually, the relationships turn from [positive sum](thoughts/positive%20sum.md) to [zero sum](thoughts/zero%20sum.md). Thus, to continue growing, they must extract from users (e.g. selling user data, taxing profits, etc.)\n\n\u003e Centralized systems often start out fully baked, but only get better at the rate at which employees at the sponsoring company improve them. Decentralized systems start out half-baked but, under the right conditions, grow exponentially as they attract new contributors.\n\n## Why Decentralize?\n1. [**Fault tolerance**](thoughts/fault%20tolerance.md), less likely to fail accidentally because they rely on many separate redundant components\n2. **Attack resistance**, no central point to attack\n3. **Collusion resistance**\n\n### Decentralization as Activism\n[Source: Resistant protocols: How decentralization evolves by *John Backus*](https://www.gwern.net/docs/technology/2018-07-25-johnbackus-howdecentralizationevolves.html)\n\n\u003e Decentralization doesn't work in a vacuum, mainstream decentralized systems require a degree of activism to keep the system working\n\n\"BitTorrent seems to represent the minimum viable decentralization required to stay alive as defined by the law at the time\"\n\nDecentralization is a tactic for diffusing risk for many and lowering the risk for the activists that operate the most sensitive parts of the system.\n\n**Over applying decentralization isn't a strategy unless your goal is obscurity**\n\n### Counterpoints\n#### [[thoughts/fault tolerance|Fault Tolerance]]\nCommon mode failure, all pieces can fail for the same reason. (e.g. all nodes in a blockchain run the same software but that software has a bug)\n\nTo counteract this,\n- have multiple competing implementations\n- knowledge of technical considerations behind underlying [protocol](thoughts/Protocol.md) must be public and democratized\n- core stakeholders should be from multiple companies/orgs or just multiple volunteers\n- use [proof of stake](thoughts/proof%20of%20stake.md) to move away from hardware centralization risk\n\n#### Attack Resistance\nFrom a purely mathematical and game theory perspective, decentralization may not even matter. In a finality reversion (e.g. 51% attack), a huge loss of say $50M is still $50M regardless of whether you have validators in 1 org or 10.\n\nHowever, after considering coercion, decentralization becomes much more important. It's much harder to threaten 100 people than 1.\n\n#### Collusion Resistance\n\u003e Collusion is \"coorindation that we don't like\"\n\n[Consensus](thoughts/consensus.md) model relies on **uncoordinated choice model**, the asusmption that the game consists of many small actors that make decisions independently\n\nYet, 90% of the entire Bitcion network's mining power can show up at the same conference (as 7 men). Yet, some coordination is good (e.g. strong community spirit and banding together to implement patches and fix bugs)\n\nWays to counteract:\n1. Find a happy medium that allows enough coordination for a protocol to move forward but not enough to enable attacks\n2.

    "content": "\nGoals in the context of HCI are things that can be defined in a given context, then evaluated.\n\nHuman task involves the steps to do something, whereas human needs are general wants of the user, what they want to get accomplished. Usability goals are primarily objective, user experience goals are more subjective.\n\n### Usability Goals\nUsability refers to ensuring that interactive products are easy to learn, effective to use, and enjoyable from the user's perspective. Following 6 goals:\n\n1. Effective to use (effectiveness). Is the product capable of allowing people to learn, carry out their work efficiently, access the information that they need, or buy the goods that they want?\n2. Efficient to use (efficiency). Once users have learned how to use a product to carry out their tasks, can they sustain a high level of productivity?\n3. Safe to use (safety). What is the range of errors that are possible using the product, and what measures are there to permit users to recover easily from them?\n4. Having good utility (utility). Does the product provide an appropriate set of functions that will enable users to carry out all of their tasks in the way they want to do them?\n5. Easy to learn (learnability). Is it possible for the user to work out how to use the product by exploring the interface and trying certain actions? How hard will it be to learn the whole set of functions in this way? Should have good transfer effects (where knowledge acquired earlier improves one's ability to learn/perform in another context)\n6. Easy to remember how to use (memorability). What types of interface support have been provided to help users remember how to carry out tasks, especially for products and operations they use infrequently?\n\nExamples of commonly used usability criteria\n-   time to complete a task (efficiency)\n-   time to learn a task (learnability)\n-   number of errors made when carrying out a task over time (memorability)\n\n### User Experience Goals\nThese are concerned with how users experience an interactive product from their perspective, rather than assessing how useful or productive a system is from its own perspective\n\nDesirable aspects of UX\n- Satisfying\n- Enjoyable\n- Helpful\n- Fun\n- Provocative\n\nUndesirable aspects of UX\n- Making one feel stupid or guilty\n- Cutesy\n- Gimmicky\n- Frustrating\n\nThese are combined in a user's multi-faceted experience of a product\n\n### Design Principles\n\u003e Generalizable abstractions intended to orient designers toward thinking about different aspects of their designs\n\nConcerned with what users should see and do when carrying out their tasks using an interactive product: the dos and don'ts of interaction design.\n\n1. High visibility: ensure functions are easy to find and intuitive.\n2. Feedback: time sensitive information about what actions has been done and what has been accomplished.\n3. Constraints: ways of restricting the user interaction to those which are valid in any given moment.\n4. Consistency: an interface which follows rules, such as using the same operation to select all objects.\n5. Affordance: attributes should obviously signal what they can use it for. Afford means \"to give a clue\"\n\nThe problem when applying these to real world is that trade-offs can arise between principles (e.g. increased constraint might mean less visibility).",

Discovering requirements (discover/define phase). Deciding what to design is key, and exploring the problem space is one way to decide. The goal is understanding the target users and the support an interactive product could provide.\n2. Designing alternatives (develop phase). This can be 2 parts, conceptual design (producing the conceptual model of the product) or concrete design (detail of the product like colours, sounds, images, etc.)\n3. Prototyping alternative designs to be communicated and assessed (develop phase). The process of designing behaviour of interactive products as well as look and feel. Doesn't necessarily need working software!\n4. Evaluating the product and the UX it offers (develop phase). Determine the usability and acceptability of the product or design measured in terms of a variety of usability and user-experience criteria.\n\nHere are a few good questions to ask to better understand the problem:\n-   what are the human needs?\n-   who are the stakeholders?\n-   what are the central tasks?\n-   what might we want to learn? (evaluation goals)\n-   who should our participants be?\n\n## Requirements\nRequirements are **stable** descriptions of users' aspirations, goals, constraints, expectations etc that form a sound basis from which to start design activities (not rigid, might shift over long periods of time). They are also statements about an intended product that specifies what it is expected to do or how it will perform.\n\nDiscovering and communicating reqs is important bc defining what needs to be built supports technical developers and allows users to contribute more effectively\n\n### Steps\n1.  identify **human needs**\n-   which the proposed interactive system will support; task, goals, conditions; current problems and strengths\n2.  identify all **users and other stakeholders**\n-   who do or perform the activity: groups, capabilities, motives, needs\n3.  set **levels of support (metrics)**\n-   functionalities the system will provide; environmental constraints and user/stakeholder characteristics\n-   metrics: how we know if we have succeeded → can be quantitative or qualitative\n-   fit criterion is something that can be used to assess when the solution meets the requirement\n\n### Kinds\n1. **functional requirements:** describe what the product will do\n2.  **nonfunctional requirements:** describe the characteristics (sometimes called constraints) of the product\n\t1.  **data requirements:** capture type, volatility, size/amount, persistence, accuracy, and value of required data\n\t\t-   eg. app for buying/selling stocks has to have up-to-date and accurate data which is likely to change many times a day\n\t2.  **environmental requirements:** context of use; circumstances in which the interactive product will operate. made up of:\n\t\t1.  **physical environment:** lighting, noise, movement, dust expected in operational environment. Will users need to wear protective clothing, which may affect the choice of interface type?\n\t\t2.  **social environment**: will data need to be shared? does sharing have to be synchronous or async?\n\t\t3.  **organizational environment**: how good is user support likely to be, how easily is it obtained, how efficient or stable is the communication infrastructure, etc?\n\t\t4.  **technical environment**: what tech will the product run on or need to be compatible with, and what technological limitations might be relevant?\n\t3.  **user characteristics:** capture key attributes of user group. collection of characteristics for a typical user is a **user profile**\n\t\t-   eg. abilities and skills, educational background, preference, personal circumstances, disabilities, novice/expert/casual or frequent user etc\n\t4.  **usability goals and user experience goals**\n\t\t-   **usability engineering:** approach in which specific measures for usability goals are agreed upon early in the dev process and used to track progress",

And while Facebook and Twitter may be open to all, as in those gardens, their owners determine the rules.\n\n- [[thoughts/friction|friction]] is essential to public space.\n\t- \"Public spaces are so generative precisely because we run into people we’d normally avoid, encounter events we’d never expect, and have to negotiate with other groups that have their own needs.\"\n\t- Rapid growth can quickly overwhelm and destroy it—as anyone who has lived in a gentrifying neighborhood knows.\n- public goods require constant, active care and [[thoughts/maintenance|maintenance]]\n\t- nuanced labor of governance and maintenance—finding the balance between welcoming everyone and providing safety and comfort for everyone—is critical to the health of online communities\n\n## Internet Studio Gardens\nBy [Jon Borichevskiy](https://jon.bo/posts/internet-studio-gardens/)\n\n[[thoughts/software principles|Principles for Internet Spaces]]\n1. Places where they might drift over to peers in adjacent spaces for the chance – but not the obligation – to respond or otherwise reflect upon, completing the loop at the speed of a lazy river instead of a light circuit (see: [friction](thoughts/friction.md), [pace layers](thoughts/pace%20layers.md))\n2. There might even be different seasons of [play](thoughts/play.md): periods of divergent planting and nurturing followed by collective harvesting and pruning (see: [exploit explore](thoughts/exploit%20explore.md))\n3. Just permeable enough to be discovered by those curious enough to add their own drawings and words. Details just hidden enough to be carefully unearthed by the intentional visitor\n\n## Creating Digital Spaces\nCan we create digital common spaces like parks and things without everyone online needing to be exceedingly intentioned?\n\nCommons should be safe, low pressure contexts for random interaction. They are public spaces where a lot of people coincidentally share the same space for a short period in time. It has the same energy as commuting -- a familiar yet ever-changing context.\n\nThe park and the trees may stay the same most times you visit yet the people on the benches and walking on the paved paths are always different. One can sit and observe all the people moving by, [wondering what their life is like.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People-watching).\n\n\u003e \"What would it look like to do that with your favourite internet neighbourhoods?\"\n\nThis is a small reflection on potential new avenues to explore for digital spaces. Not to say that any existing ones are bad but I am interested to see what new direction we can take to explore how we use technology to further human connection.\n\n### Serendipity in Public Spaces\nSerendipity is bumping into new people you otherwise wouldn't have talked to or sought out. It's the casual bus or subway chatter, the queue neighbour, or stranger reading on a park bench. It's the opposite of intentionality.\n\nAre there ways to be _less_ intentional with digital interactions?\n\nIf you want to meet with someone you need to schedule it or visit a link, etc. There is no 'random' interaction. Even algorithmic experiences are like being carried away by the TikTok or Facebook algorithm rather than something out of the blue. Though these experiences may seem random at times, they are explicitly curated with an _end goal_ in mind.\n\nAre there any spaces that don't have ulterior motives and are just places of gathering? The only example that comes to mind where 'coincidental' interaction happen is within currated [interest groups](thoughts/social%20graphs.md) like online network forums around [games](thoughts/games.md) or technologies or early communities lead by superconnectors like the [Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link (WELL)](thoughts/From%20Counterculture%20to%20Cyberculture.md). How can we recreate these public 'watering holes' for people to gather around? \n\n### Permanence in Private Spaces\nPermanence means that the environment reflects that people have been there. A shared garden to tend to, a bookshelf to work through, a guestbook of all the people who have dropped in and out.\n\nSo many of our mediums have now tended towards [real time](thoughts/ephemereal%20content.md) in an effort to replicate the fleeting nature of face-to-face conversation; vanishing messages, video chats, and audio rooms. Yet, rarely do any of these platforms leave any indication whether a conversation ever happened between two people.\n\nIs there any way we can create shared *artifacts* that are permanent and can be grown over time? A digital indication that a space is lived in and occupied?\n\nAs of now, most platforms keep a primative chat log or history but thats it. What if there was a way to create digital [gardens](https://twitter.com/samihusseni/status/1329499588982575104) to foster and maintain existing relationships? A commonspace you could both take care of, share, and contribute to. Completely private common spaces often allow users to put whatever and allow people can construct their own digital nooks and cozy spaces.\n\nMaybe this involves having a shared calendar, todo list, books. Or even just a space to co-live and co-exist in [virtual worlds](thoughts/virtual%20worlds.md). Most online RPG games (think Animal Crossing, Minecraft, Stardew valley) give the option for users to have a shared space to exist and build together (and where both people don't necessarily both need to be present for the space to function). Why doesn't this exist outside of the gaming sphere?\n\nCan we create permanence of artifacts without sacrificing ephemerality in medium?\n\n## Tools for Digital Spaces\nGiven that there are so many different types of digital spaces, I wanted to explore how different tools are supporting and facilitating different sorts of digital human interaction. Can we use urban planning to help us [plan digital spaces](https://medium.com/@jasminewsun/jane-jacobs-social-media-83b4265a1d12)?\n\nThe hope is to be able to move away from the 'feed'-based model of browsing the social internet and to create safe spaces to interact at different scales.\n\n\u003e The “feed”–an archaic form of content consumption that is effectively just a direct visual manifestation of the data structure that powers it – is a medium that is effectively designed to be consumed alone.  --[Humphrey Obuobi](https://www.somewheregood.com/garden/trust-and-safety/)\n\n### Town Square\nMany-to-many relationships like clubs, families, larger interest groups. \n\n#### Questions\n* How do we ensure that people feel connected in large groups and find \nwhat they are looking for?\n* Should communities be gated or public?

The result was the centralization and consolidation of the Internet — the true y2k tragedy. This tragedy unfolded in stages, a gradual infringement of rights: users had to first be made transparent to their internet service providers, and then they were made transparent to the internet services they used, and finally they were made transparent to one another. The intimate linking of users' online personas with their offline legal identity was an iniquitous squandering of liberty and technology that has resulted in today's atmosphere of accountability for the citizen and impunity for the state. Gone were the days of self-reinvention, imagination, and flexibility, and a new era emerged — a new eternal era — where our pasts were held against us. Forever.\"\n\n\"Everything we do now lasts forever... The Internet's synonymizing of digital presence and physical existence ensures fidelity to memory, identitarian consistency, and ideological conformity. Be honest: if one of your opinions provokes the hordes on social media, you're less likely to ditch your account and start a new one than you are to apologize and grovel, or dig in and harden yourself ideologically. Neither of those \"solutions\" is one that fosters change, or intellectual and emotional growth\"\n\n\"The forced identicality of online and offline lives, and the permanency of the Internet's record, augur against forgiveness, and advise against all mercy. Technological omniscence, and the ease of accessibility, promulgate a climate of censorship that in the so-called free world instantiates as self-censorship: people are afraid to speak and so they speak the party's words... or people are afraid to speak and so they speak no words at all...\"\n\n\"Even the most ardent practitioners of cancel culture — which I've always read as an imperative: Cancel culture! — must admit that cancellation is a form of surveillance borne of the same technological capacities used to oppress the vulnerable by patriachal, racist, and downright unkind governments the world over. The intents and outcomes might be different — cancelled people are not sent to camps — but the modus is the same: a constant monitoring, and a rush to judgment.\"",

Homo economicus: The most common behavioral model assumes that humans are atomic individuals who operate rationally and selfishly.  We know now that humans have limited attention, are contextually altruistic, are highly [tribe flourishing](thoughts/tribe%20flourishing.md), and exhibit a wide range of irrational cognitive biases.\n2. Individuals are the best judge of their needs: Our brains are not conscious of the base psychological processes driving some of our most pressing needs and are thus unable to value relationships rationally.\n3. Weak social modeling: Most economics models ignore basic human behavior such as friendship networks, affiliation networks, limits on cognitive resources (ex: attention) or altruism.\n\nEconomics embraces reductive utilitarianism and posits you can put a price on anything. We tend to be intrinsically motivated to connect to others and invest long term in a relationship where no extrinsic value is ever publicly admitted. When a relationship transitions into being an extrinsically rewarded transactional relationship, the relationship often suffers a catastrophic loss of value. (This is the same reason that just throwing money at [open source software](thoughts/Making%20and%20Maintenance%20of%20OSS.md) often doesn't work, it kills the intrinsic drive to create)\n\n### [Selfishness](thoughts/selfish.md)\n[Source: Does Studying Economics Breed Greed? by *Adam Grant*](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/give-and-take/201310/does-studying-economics-breed-greed)\n\nThose that practice economics — and to a degree modern American capitalism — are heavily invested in an implicit system of self-centered moral values.\n\n\"The repetitive doctrine that humans are best modeled as selfish rational optimizers creates a set of selfish social norms that practitioners consciously or subconsciously follow. The act of studying economics makes you a morally worse human-being (by most definitions of morality.)\"\n\nHow do we move beyond the study of scarcity and towards a study of abundance and [positive sum](thoughts/positive%20sum.md) goods?

Most people still say no.\n\n\"We are all in that situation of the person passing the shallow pond. We can all save the lives of people, both children and adults, who would otherwise die, and we can do so at a very small cost to us: the cost of a new CD, a shirt, or a night out at a restaurant or concert, can mean the difference between life and death to more than one person somewhere in the world.\"",

As such, finesses rather than solves the frame problem\n\n### Merleau-Ponty's discriminatory model\n-  as an agent learned, skills are not stored as internal representations\n-   rather experiences are presented to the learned as more finely discriminated situations\n\t-   e.g. as you learn to cook, experiences are presented that are more finely discriminated like having a better cooked egg vs a poorly done one\n-  if the situation does not clearly solicit a single response or if the response does not produce a satisfactory result, the learner is led to further refine the discrimination\n\n### Walter Freeman's neurodynamic model\n-   basic Cartesian model\n\t1.  the brain receives input from the universe by way of its sense organs\n\t2.  out of this stimulus information, the brain abstracts features, which it uses to construct a representation of the world\n-  Treat the computer/brain as a passive receiver of bits of meaningless data, which then have significance added to them\n\t-   big problem is, how the brain binds the relevant features together (searle's chinese room)\n-   concept of energy states\n\t-   state tends toward minimum \"energy\"\n\t-   minimum energy states are called attractors\n\t-   brain states that tend towards a particular attractor are called that attractor's \"basin of attraction\"\n\t-   when learning, the brain forms a new basin of attraction for each new significant class of inputs → significance of past experience is preserved in an attractor landscape\n-   each new attractor does not represent a thing, rather, the brain's current state is the result of the sum of the animal's past experience with the thing\n\t-   constantly updated landscape of attractors is correlated with the agent's experience of the changing significance of things in the world (intentional arc)\n-   no fixed representations, when an animal learns to respond to a new odor, there is a shift in all other patterns (even those not directly involved with the learning)\n\t-  different from GOFAI, memory stores in computers in which each item is positioned by a discrete address or branch of search tree",

Epistemic Culture: what do members of the culture take to be valid sources of knowledge\n\t2.

Inference\n- Dogmatism: when one cannot understand differences in epistemic cultures\n- We're finite, we can only think and see certain amounts of the world and so our brains and bodies are in sub-personal way always helping us intelligently ignore huge swaths of information\n- Question about demarcation of appeals to authority between good and bad turns into a much larger question that goes into the [philosophy of mind](thoughts/philosophy%20of%20mind.md) and philosophy of neuroscience, the nature of [the self](thoughts/the%20Self.md), how that is created, and how that thing epistemically gains and accesses information in the first place through retention\n- Defeaters\n\t- Overriding defeater: given evidence presented, this piece of evidence is a countering piece of evidence that overrides the argument for what they're saying\n\t- Undermining/undercutting defeater: some kind of source is fundamentally wrong and nothing comes out of it\n- Is it worth to assess overriding testimonial information from authorities? Whether critical thinking is good?\n\t- Michael Huemer: you shouldn't! Critically thinking is epistemically irresponsible.\n\t\t- We can look to scientific cultures as epistemic enterprises for techniques to make things more robust\n\t- Anand's counter-argument: you always need to critically evaluate at least the following\n\t\t1. who are the authorities?\n\t\t2. are they currently properly performing their authority?\n\t\t3. what does their authority amount to, within their expertise?\n\t- In being an expert and giving expert testimony means that we want the expertise that the person has to be spoken for and performed -- we want an expert performance\n\t\t- Can be suspect when the information upon which the expert is drawing is ambiguous\n\t\t- Skepticism starts to creep in because of the bureaucratic complexity through which the message is being delivered\n\t\t\t- Media wise\n\t\t\t- Interface between medical professions and politics\n\t\t\t- Corporations that are providing the actual vaccines\n\t- \"Best bet view\": if the weighted average of authorities who meet these tests say something, we should trust that it's true (this depends on epistemic culture and epistemic self)\n- Throwing something from one epistemic culture that's disjoint from another epistemic culture cannot lead to reconciliation without a shared epistemic culture\n- Two views on argumentation\n\t- Epistemic: trading of assertions has a way of leading to a better epistemic position either for both parties or for the conjunction of the two parties ([positive sum](thoughts/positive%20sum.md))\n\t- Non-epistemic: trying to pull one side to another ([zero sum](thoughts/zero%20sum.md))\n- Not only an issue of [trust](thoughts/trust.md) but also psychological exhaustion. One of the requirements of any epistemic enterprise is the use of attention\n\t- Information that puts its receivers into an almost constant state of some kind of cognitive dissonance negative impacts their ability to attend and assess the information\n- It is incredibly important to understand who is an epistemic peer and epistemic non-peers and the differences between peer-disagreement and non-peer-disagreement\n\t- Huemer counterpoint: non-peers can still be good at catching peers in their performance\n- Punditry: speaking with a certain level of diction, speed, volume, etc. and it will sound like whatever you are saying is true\n- One of the main components of collective action is collective belief. We want everyone to do $f$ but that requires everyone to believe that doing $f$ is right\n- How to ensure it's possible to accurately evaluate whether or not someone is an authority\n\t- Negative: Not always useful to be screaming about bias\n\t\t- At any scale reasonably worth caring about, bias will exist as long as there is order to the universe and entropy hasn't taken over. Bias is what enables salience, for distinction to even be made among differing classes.\n\t\t- However, bias in the context of decision making is something that is seen as a strict negative. Bias here (in the form of preexisting bias, technical bias, or emergent bias) implies a negative systematic preference for the epistemic trust of some agent over enough. \n\t- Positive: Look at it mathematically, think about what's at stake and think about what the tolerance threshold is that we can have in the relevant domain\n\t\t- From a purely mathematical perspective, this is factual. Achieving consensus is difficult, especially among a wide net of epistemic agents. In fact, without formal processes like voting or delegation, just peer-based discussion leads to a factorial explosion in time-taken to reach consensus.\n\t\t- Thus in most cases, rough consensus (I found this proposal particularly interesting: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7282) or trusting delegates (e.g. authorities like the CDC) to not be biased and accurately evaluate other authorities (e.g. scientists and pharmaceutical companies responsible for inventing/deploying the vaccine) is usually suitable when balancing tradeoffs between speed (for example when timeliness during a pandemic is important) and correctness (making sure vaccines are safe to the general public).\n\t- Positive: Increased diversity (of critical thinking skills) leads to a decrease in the probability of the whole group being accurate in evaluating whether or not someone is an authority. You can fool some people some of the time but you can't fool all the people all of the time\n\t\t- I agree with Lincoln here in saying that diversity is greatly important for reducing the chance we 'flatten' entire perspectives and ignore critical facts. *The Unflattening* by Nick Sousanis is a great graphic novel exploring how having a limited number of fixed perspectives prevents one from seeing the whole picture.\n\t- Positive: Listen to voices not being heard and figuring out how to repackage what they're saying in a way that is significant -- it is a unique skill to be trained as a cross-cultural philosopher. These philosophers can then teach experts to communicate better.\n\t\t- Unsure about how this is super relevant to accurately assessing whether one is to be trusted as an epistemic authority. Yes, I agree that being a cross-cultural philosopher is important. I believe that philosophers are the [boundary people](thoughts/boundary%20object.md) between multiple fields and enable cross-field germination.

A **Byzantine failure** is the loss of a system service due to a Byzantine fault in systems that require [consensus](thoughts/consensus.md) between notes.\n\nByzantine fault tolerance (BFT) is the property of a system that is able to resist the class of failures derived from the Byzantine Generals’ Problem. This means that a BFT system is able to continue operating even if some of the nodes fail or act maliciously.\n\n\"Note that the PoW algorithm is not 100% tolerant to the Byzantine faults, but due to the and the underlying cryptographic techniques, PoW has proven to be one of the most secure and reliable implementations for blockchain networks.\"\n\n### Two Generals Problem\nThis thought experiment meant to illustrate the pitfalls and design challenges of attempting to coordinate an action by communicating over an unreliable link. In the experiment, two generals are only able to communicate with one another by sending a messenger through enemy territory. The experiment asks how they might reach an agreement on the time to launch an attack, while knowing that any messenger they send could be captured. It is required that the two generals have their armies attack the city simultaneously to succeed, lest the lone attacker army die trying.\n\nBecause acknowledgement of message receipt can be lost as easily as the original message, a potentially infinite series of messages is required to come to consensus.\n\nThis problem is unsolvable.\n\n### Byzantine Generals Problem\nThis situation can be expressed abstractly in terms of a group of generals of the Byzantine army camped with their troops around an enemy city. Communicating only by messenger, the generals must agree upon a common battle plan. However, one or more of them may be traitors who will try to confuse the others. The problem is to find an algorithm to ensure that the loyal generals will reach agreement.\n\nIt is shown that, using only oral messages, this problem is solvable if and only if more than two-thirds of the generals are loyal; so a single traitor can confound two loyal generals. With unforgeable written messages, the problem is solvable for any number of generals and possible traitors.\n\n",

Practical deliberation: \n2. Theoretical deliberation: \n\n- Partiality: You are more likely to do certain things for someone that you wouldn’t do for others.\n- Doxastic partiality: You are more likely to believe in it\n\nWe can be partial to your friends but they can be wrong given state-given reasons. We can be partial to our friends but not because it is normative to be always partial to our friends\n\n- Partialist: those who argue that friendship can normatively require doxastic partiality\n\t- Someone who failed to be doxastically partial to you would fail to be a good friend to you\n\t- We *ought* (normative statement) to do the various things that partly constitutive of what it is to be a good friend to someone (e.g. be doxastically partial)\n\t\t- This statement stems from the idea that good friendships are invaluable and indispensible component of living a good life. In turn, it makes sense that we ought to cultivate and sustain good friendships\n- Evidentialists: people who claim that what we ought to believe only subject to epistemic reasons, which are directly, transparently available as evidence during deliberation\n\t- There are no reasons to be doxastically partial, because, more generally, there are no non-evidential reasons for belief\n\t- Transparency: the question of whether to believe $p$ gives way to the factual question of whether $p$ holds true because the answer to the latter question determines the answer to the former\n\t\t- First gloss: we inevitably first consult the evidence in deliberation\n\t\t- Second gloss: normative point that evidence is the *only* thing relative in deliberation\n\t\t- However, it is true that $p$ not being true does not stop one from believing that $p$\n\t\t\t- Being a good friend, in my view, need not require being right about what sorts of qualities genuinely deserve one’s love or admiration.\n\nOn deliberation: deliberation concludes in an *attitude* of some kind, not the action itself\n- Practical deliberation about whether to do $\\phi$ concludes in an intention to $\\phi$\n\t- However, practical deliberation can be about theoretical deliberation\n- Theoretical deliberation about whether to believe that $p$\n\nState-given vs appropriately responsive attitudes\n- A reason for an attitude is *state-given* when its status as a reason is grounded in some relation it bears to a property of having that attitude in one's circumstances. e.g. an evil demon will torture you unless you believe that 2 + 2 = 5 is a state given reason to *believe* that 2 + 2 = 5.\n\t- Thus, the approach to thinking that esteeming a good friend because you expect them to esteem you in return is a state-give reason for esteeming them (e.g. makes esteeming the friend practically advantageous)\n- As opposed to appropriately responsive attitudes. These reasons for attitudes are appropriately responsive when they are responsive to what one takes to be \"object-given reasons\" -- that is, it is grounded in some relation that bears to a property of the object of the attitude\n\t- The belief that a friend is kind purely because your friend's kindness is a property of your friend (that is, they actually have the feature)\n\n## Epistemic Norms, The False Belief Requirement, and Love\nBy J. Spencer Atkins\n\nArgues that the demands of romantic love requires that we sometimes become bad epistemic agents\n\n\u003e Companionship is pleasurable and consequently valuable because it affords the opportunity to feel “seen” by another. We can only, according to Braden, view ourselves conceptually—we know things about ourselves—but we need others to view ourselves perceptually, “as concrete objects ‘out there.’” Other consciousnesses function like a mirror. Being seen in this way is recognition of personhood. The feeling of being seen is psychological visibility. Romantic love affords a “uniquely powerful” experience of visibility because lovers share a fascination with one another unlike any other relationship.\n\nDoxastic voluntarism: we can make ourselves belief a proposition\n\n1. False Belief Requirement\n\t- Argues that romantic love sometimes poses the demand to believe falsely\n\t- Knowledge as JTB (see [Knowledge Argument](thoughts/Knowledge%20Argument.md)): $S$ believes that $p$, $S$ is justified in believing that $p$, and $p$ is true\n\t- Belief then, is not knowledge as one can hold false beliefs\n\t- W.K. Clifford: \"It is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone to believe anything upon insufficient evidence\"\n\t- When love poses the false belief argument, love will be opposed to epistemic norms\n\t- Delaney argues that lovers desire to be loved for the right reasons. That is, person $A$ wants a romantic partner $B$ to love him for properties that $A$ takes central to their self-conception\n2. Doxastic Wronging (the demand not to wrong one another)\n\t- True beliefs can wrong\n\t\t- Example, base rates: \"For instance, suppose that the swanky DC night club, the Cosmos Club, has nearly all black employees and nearly all white club members. A person looking for an employee, where employees and club members both wear tuxedoes, would be epistemically rational to believe that some particular black person is an employee, given the base rate at the Cosmos Club\"\n\t- Three conditions of doxastic wronging\n\t\t1. Directed Condition: belief wrongs a particular person, not just wrong in general\n\t\t2. Belief Itself Condition: holding the belief is what wrongs (not how the belief was formed or the actions that follow from the belief)\n\t\t3. Content Condition: content of the belief wrongs\n\t- Lovers stand in a privileged position -- they know things not usually shared with other people. This position makes them especially vulnerable to doxastic wronging\n\n### Love and False Belief\n*Week 9 Essay for PHIL 240A*\n\n\u003e Evaluate Atkins' argument that love sometimes requires false belief. (Remember that to evaluate an argument, you have to explain what it is, and then say why it is or is not convincing).\n\nAtkin's argument that love sometimes rqeuires false belief extends upon the work of Sarah Stroud and Simon Keller about the conflicts between relationships and epistemology. Both Stroud and Keller claim that those who know each other intimately (either platonic or romantic) should owe each other epistemic partiality. However, Atkin's extends this further and posits that love requires \"something beyond epistemic partiality -- false beliefs.\"\n\nAtkin's calls this the False Belief Requirement (FBR). Atkin's then tries to argue that love is opposed to epistemic norms as follows:\n1. Knowledge is justified true belief (JTB): $S$ believes that $p$, $S$ is justified in believing that $p$, and $p$ is true\n2. Belief then cannot be knowledge as one can hold beliefs that are false\n3. Thus, when poses the false belief argument, love will be opposed to epistemic norms (and thus rationality)\n\nDelaney argues that lovers desire to be loved for the right reasons. That is, person $A$ wants a romantic partner $B$ to love them for properties that $A$ takes central to their self-conception. Atkins then claims that false beliefs are required in order to avoid doxastic wrong-doing -- the wronging of another by having beliefs that do not align with the other's self-conception.\n\nHere, I don't think Atkins' line of argumentation is correct. I agree with Delaney's point about lovers wanting to be loved for properties that they take central to their self-conception. However, I don't think that false beliefs are required for this want to hold true.\n\nTake for example, the cases of *striving* that Atkin's mentions. Cases of striving, as Atkin defines it, occurs when one prematurely sees themselves as what they desire to become. Specifically, \"truth is not required, for example, in striving cases where we desire to premature be seen as what we hope to become.\" Let me illustrate why this is not the case.\n\nSay I want to become a painter -- I am striving to be a painter. But I generally do not claim that I *am* a painter until I am confident and believe that to be the case. If I *do* say that \"I am a painter,\" this is a case of 'fake it until you make it'. The actual underlying belief (and hope) is that I will *eventually be* a painter rather than actually believing that I currently am a painter. In this example, one explicitly repeats an obviously false statement *to others* in order to get external social reinforcement to create necessary social structures to enforce this to happen. My partner then knows that this statement is not necessarily a statement about my current skill with painting but rather a *wish* about a future skill of painting. They would not take the obviously false statement at face value and instead believes in the underlying *true* belief that I strive to be a painter. Much like sarcasm, those socially aware of the situation will believe the real deeper intention over the facade statement. This, to me, is a clear flaw in Atkin's argument that love requires false belief.\n\n",

Read as: whatever you give me, I will return the unit value\n\n## Terminology\n![[thoughts/images/Haskell typeclasses.png]]\n\n### Category Theory\nIn essence, a simple collection which can be thought of as a graph. Three components\n1. A collection of objects (nodes)\n2. A collection of morphisms (edges).\n\t- If $f$ is a morphism with source C and target B, we write $f: C \\rightarrow B$\n3. A notion of composition of morphisms. \n\t- If we have $g: A \\rightarrow B$ and $f: B \\rightarrow C$, they can be composed resulting in a morphism $f \\circ g: A \\rightarrow C$\n\t- Composition of morphisms needs to be associative. Typically applied right to left\n\nCategory theory to Haskell\n- Objects are *types*\n- Morphisms are *functions*\n- Things that take a type and return another type are *type constructors*\n- Things that take a function and return another function are *higher-order functions*\n- Typeclasses capture the fact that things are often defined for a 'set' of objects at once\n\n### Functor\n\u003e A 'container' of some sort, along with the ability to apply a function uniformly to every element in it\n\nEssentially a transformation between categories. Given categories $C$ and $D$ and a functor $F: C \\rightarrow D$\n1. $F$ maps any object $A \\in C$ to $F(A) \\in D$ (the type constructor)\n2. $F$ maps morphisms $f: A \\rightarrow B \\in C$ to $F(f): F(A) \\rightarrow F(B) \\in D$ (`fmap`). Importantly, this means that all functors must be generic over at least one parameter (e.g. `Maybe` and not `Integer`)\n\t- applying `fmap` is sometimes called 'lifting' as it lifts a function from the normal context into the 'f' world\n\n```haskell\nclass Functor f where\n\t-- fmap maps morphisms\n\tfmap :: (a -\u003e b) -\u003e f a -\u003e f b\n\n\t-- applies a 'constant' function to replace the values in a container\n\t(\u003c$) :: a -\u003e f b -\u003e f a\n\t-- default implementation\n\t(\u003c$) = fmap . const\n```\n\n`fmap` takes a function which maps a value from `a` to `b` and applies it to a Functor `f`. Think of `f` as the container, `(a -\u003e b)` as the function that operates on the 'inner' values.\n\n### Monad\nMonads are functors from a category $A$ to that same category. A container for values that can be mapped over.\n\nA monad is a functor $M: C \\rightarrow C$ along with two morphisms $\\forall X \\in C$\n1. $\\textrm{unit}_X : X \\rightarrow M(X)$ (`return`)\n2. $\\textrm{join}_X: M(M(X)) \\rightarrow M(X)$ (can be recovered from `bind`)\n\n```haskell\nclass Monad m where\n  -- join operation (optional, only one of bind or join need to be defined)\n  join :: m (m a) -\u003e m a\n\n  -- bind operation\n  -- takes an f :: (a -\u003e m b) and applies it to\n  -- the inner value a of m\n  (\u003e\u003e=)  :: m a -\u003e (a -\u003e m b) -\u003e m b\n\n  -- replaces m a with m b\n  (\u003e\u003e)   :: m a -\u003e  m b       -\u003e m b\n\n  -- constructs the simplest monad m using a\n  return ::   a               -\u003e m a\n```\n\nMonad laws\n```haskell\nreturn a \u003e\u003e= k                  =  k a\nm        \u003e\u003e= return             =  m\nm        \u003e\u003e= (\\x -\u003e k x \u003e\u003e= h)  =  (m \u003e\u003e= k) \u003e\u003e= h\n```\n\n## Left and Right Associativity\nAssociativity of an operator determines how operators are grouped in the absence of parentheses.\n\nFor the following examples, we consider a fictional operator `~`\n\n1. Associative: operations can be grouped arbitrarily (e.g. addition, order doesn't matter)\n2. Left-associative: operations are grouped left to right\n\t1. `a ~ b ~ c` is interpreted as `(a ~ b) ~ c`\n\t2. Examples include\n\t\t1. Function application operator\n3. Right-associative: operations are grouped right to left\n\t1. `a ~ b ~ c` is interpreted as `a ~ (b ~ c)`\n\t2. Examples include\n\t\t1. Variable assignment (`=`)\n\t\t2. Exponentiation (`^`)\n4. Non-associative: operations cannot be chained\n\n## Parser Combinators\n\u003e Parser combinators are a technique for implementing parsers by defining them in terms of other parsers\n\nNotes on [Chumsky](https://github.com/zesterer/chumsky)\n\nWhere `a` and `b` are both parsers.\n\nParser Methods\n1. `just(a)` accepts a single string `a`\n2. `a.or(b)` parse `a`, if `a` fails, try parsing `b`\n3. `a.choice(b,c,d...)` try parsing `b`, `c`, `d`, return first one that succeeds\n4. `a.or_not()` optionally parse `a`\n5. `a.ignore_then(b)` ignore pattern `a` then parse `b`\n6. `a.then_ignore(b)` parse `a` then ignore `b`\n7. `a.then(b)` parse both `a` and `b` and return a tuple of `(a,b)`\n8. `a.padded()` ignore whitespace around `a`\n9. `a.repeated().at_least(n)` parse `a` at least `n` times\n10. `a.filter(fn)` only accept `a` if `fn(a)` evaluates to true\n\nResult Methods\n1. `a.collect()` turn results of `a` into an iterator\n2. `a.map(b)` map results of `a` into type `b`\n3. `a.chain(b)` concatenate results of parsers `a` and `b` into collection\n4. `a.copy(b)` duplicate parser definition \n5. `a.flatten()` flatten nested collection\n6. `a.to(b)` marks result of `a` as type `b`\n7. `a.labelled(b)` label result of a with `b`\n8. `a.end()` indicate end of parser",

These simply don’t tell us much about what motivates players to play. If I were to build the game again, I would have implemented the togetherness metric for the very first private alpha.\n\nA lot of pedagogy is covers the same questions as game design (especially tutorials): how much explicit guidance should a student/player get in an activity?\n\nThe \"[vow of silence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrDZ--AuiL8)\": to preserve the joy of discovery, games should carefully structure their activities so that players will learn what they need through [play](thoughts/play.md). An approach very similar to the [constructionist](thoughts/constructionist.md) ones found in [Mindstorms](thoughts/Mindstorms.md)\n\nThe goal is to give users/players the freedom to manage their own position relative to their own intellectual \"sweet spot\"\n\n![](/thoughts/images/flow.png)\n\n## [Economics](thoughts/economics.md) and [Game Theory](thoughts/game%20theory.md)\n[Source: Prosocial economics for game design by *Daniel Cook*](https://lostgarden.home.blog/2020/01/11/prosocial-economics-for-game-design-%EF%BB%BF/)\n\n\u003e Multiplayer games can help build a player’s social support network. What would game design look like if our goals included **reducing loneliness**, **decreasing toxicity** and boosting a player’s **positive connections** with others?\n\n### Loneliness\nThe loneliness epidemic is a real thing. It has been medically associated with mortality, depression, and more. In aggregate, chronic loneliness is estimated to shorten lifespan by an average of 15 years.\n\nAdvancing age also makes us more likely to be lonely. Especially as we work on [longevity](thoughts/longevity.md) research, this is a pressing issue to try to solve.\n\nThe best games are designed to be played with [friends](thoughts/friendship.md).\n\n### Toxicity\n\u003e At the root of much toxicity is the misdirection of our human need to belong\n\nWhen humans feel like they lack membership in healthy, eudaimonic, organizations, they experience stress and seek to rapidly remedy the situation (e.g. lashing out at others in hopes that putting others down helps them rise in status).\n\nIn toxic systems every new user is potentially rewarded if they adopt toxic behaviours.\n\n### Prosocial Game Design\nThree main pitfalls\n1. Psychology: there are a lot of requirements to build friendships, like right sized groups of people, correct density, and engagement in mutually dependent reciprocal activities.\n2. Logistics: rigid human limits on how many relationships they can maintain and how long it takes them to form new ones (see: [group limits](thoughts/group%20limits.md))\n3. Economics: games are built on an economic foundation of resources (creation, transformation, trade, and consumption). However, it is hard to get economic incentives to align with those of social behaviour. \"In particular, many of the key elements required by the psychological and logistical aspects of friendship formation are systematically undervalued within common economic practices.\"\n\n### Boundaries between the real world and the [virtual world](thoughts/virtual%20worlds.md)\nThere’s limited permeability of the boundary between the real world and the cartoon world. You can think of this as the designer writing out the import / export laws for their bubble of play\n\n### Elements of the internal economy\n- Tokens: base units of quantity (can represent attention, time, or value). They act as goods, products, or currencies\n- Sources: operations that produce new tokens\n- Pools: stores of tokens\n- Sinks: operations that take tokens out of circulation\n- Transforms: transform one type of token into another\n\nThen agents who perform operations:\n- Players: human agents who trigger various transforms, sources, and sinks\n- [Black Box](thoughts/black%20box.md): computer agents or systems which also trigger transforms, sources, and sinks. Often, players attempt to understand the triggers of this black box.\n\nFrom these, we can model various phenomena like [feedback loops](thoughts/feedback%20loops.md) and ownership\n\nWe can then use these to influence [incentive](thoughts/incentives.md) structures to balance games (e.g. improve a drop rate of a weapon to better increase the rate at which a key boss is defeated)\n\nExamples of internal economic systems:\n- Leveling Systems: XP tokens\n- Items: enables players to perform various transforms on the pool (e.g. a weapon is a token which depletes enemy health tokens to generate XP tokens)\n- Chat: budget of attentional and time resources\n\n### Prosocial Values\n- Friendship: The formation and maintenance of healthy, meaningful friendship networks between players. \n- Thriving individuals: Individuals feel competence, volition, and relatedness, both for themselves and for their friends. \n- Altruism: The promotion of activities that involve intrinsically motivated altruism and cooperation. \n- Positive group norms: The spread and enforcement of shared altruistic social norms within and across groups.\n- Shared goals: The definition and adoption of shared group goals. Players work towards those goals via mutual interdependence, and achieve feelings of purpose and meaningfulness. \n\nAnti-values\n- Individual Toxicity: poorly socialized individuals resort to antisocial behaviours in an attempt to put themselves above the group.\n- Group Toxicity: intergroup friction results in unhealthy interactions\n- Loneliness: sparse relationship networks, we feel this when our social support network fails. Loneliness tells us that our current social situation is untenable long term and we should seek out connection with others.\n\n### Measuring Trust\n[Trust](thoughts/trust.md) is an internal factor that cannot be measured directly so instead we need to rely on proxies.\n1. Pairwise bonds: There are two different (_asymmetric_) bonds for any given pair of player; the bond player A to player B and the bond from player B to player A.\n2. Active time spent together: One of the easiest symmetric bond proxies is simply tracking if players are in the same area together. \n3. Success together in high trust situations\n4. Time spent talking positively to each other\n\nHowever, this 'trust value' should not be public for the sake of avoiding converting it into a metric to optimize for: [Goodhart's Law](thoughts/Goodhart's%20Law.md). Doing so may transform relationships into ones which are transactional in nature with clear extrinsic motivators in the form of your willingness to make that number go up or down. (This is also one of the reasons why ‘likes’ in social media end up being a source of toxicity and in general a very poor practice.)\n\nOne also needs to keep in mind that trust differs across social contexts\n\nFor new players, one of the scariest things is requirement to engage in specialized, high coordination group performances. Building towards high trust using a ladder:\n![](/thoughts/images/trust-ladder.png)\n\n### [Positive Sum](thoughts/positive%20sum.md) Resources\nAn economy of zero sum resources is a world of scarcity. The challenge economics attempts to solve is how we might split up these limited resources in an efficient fashion.\n\nIn [virtual worlds](thoughts/virtual%20worlds.md), we can make almost any resource positive sum. When a monster drops loot for one player, it can also drop loot for any other player that did damage.\n\nHowever, truly abundant worlds are not super fun to play in. How can we design for infinite source and imbalanced economies?\n- Per players caps: cap number of harvestable positive sum resources per player\n- Per group caps: cap total number of harvestable items per group of players\n- Transaction costs: can prevent global pooling with large transaction taxes. This encourages local resource use\n- Appropriate sinks: find ways to drain resources out of the world\n\n",

All of my [[thoughts/peer-to-peer|p2p]] infrastructure work now is to build up the tools possible to explore that space of potential games. Games as explorations in [[thoughts/interaction design|interaction design]].\n\n## A Philosophy of Games\n[A Philosophy of Games that is really a Philosophy of Life with C. Thi Nguyen](https://overcast.fm/+oiPXNKQBw)\n\n## [Quantization](thoughts/quantization.md)\n-  “The most important thing in my game designer toolbox is the point system because the point system tells the players what to care about.” -- Reiner Knizia\n- \"Quantified measures are extremely good tools for large-scale bureaucracies to organize themselves\"\n- Metrics and quantities carve out all of the subtle nuance and all the weird little information that needs a lot of shared context to understand *so* that it can travel and be transported between contexts and let it aggregate easily\n\t- \"So if you have large-scale bureaucracies that need to be organized and function coherently, then you need these kind of simple, nuance-free packets of [information](thoughts/information.md)\"\n- \"if you spend your life playing games, you’ll expect that value systems will be crisp, clear, well-defined, and quantified. And then you leave games, you’ll start looking around for— I don’t know— things to do, or institutions to be a part of, or jobs to do where the outcomes are clear, crystallized, quantified, and shared between people\"\n\n### On social media\n- A lot of times people click like because something made them laugh for a second, not because it moved them two weeks later.\n\n## Aesthetics\n- Object aesthetics: when an artist makes a thing like a painting. And you look at the thing and the thing is beautiful\n- Process aesthetics: the artist makes a thing and you interact with the thing and you’re beautiful. Your actions are beautiful, or comic, or thrilling. (I think games fall under this later category)\n\n### Games are the crystallization of doing\n- The visual arts are the crystallization of seeing... music is a crystallization of hearing... fiction is a crystallization of story telling... games are the crystallization of doing.\n\t- The game designer tells you what abilities you have and what obstacles you’ll face, but most importantly, what goals you’ll have: games are the art form that works in the medium of agency itself\n- Follows Bernard's definition of a game in [The Grasshopper](thoughts/The%20Grasshopper.md): to play a game is to voluntarily take on unnecessary obstacles for the sake of making possible the activity of overcoming them\n\n## Agency\n- I feel like games are like an existential balm for the horror of life. A lot of life is you don’t fit. You have to do things. And it sucks and it’s horrible and it’s boring. And in games, for once in your life, you know exactly what you’re doing and you know exactly that you can do it. And then you have just the right amount of ability to do it. It’s a feeling of concentrated, crystallized action\n- Game designers have sculpted these little **action universes** so that we can step into them and just have this ecstasy over and over again.\n- “I’m more worried about games breeding more Wall Street profiteers than I am about their breeding serial killers.”\n\t- The greatest power of games is that you can explore this landscape of different agencies. The greatest danger of games is that you can get sucked into this experience of just craving and wanting to be in a clear, crisp and gentle universe where you know exactly what to do and exactly how well it’s measured (similar concerns to [Goodhart's Law](thoughts/Goodhart's%20Law.md)).\n\t- So I think that the body of games is a kind of library of agencies. The real promise of games, if you take them seriously, is that by playing a ton of them, you can traverse all the different possibilities of agency.\n\n### Misc\n- \"'Train' ... looks like, in many ways, a standard European board game. You’re building a railway network. You’re trying to optimize it. And over time the game reveals to you that what you’re actually doing is it’s Nazi Germany and you’re building the railway network to move people to concentration camps.\"\n- https://buriedwithoutceremony.com/the-quiet-year\n",

Illustrate with an example.\n\nHermeneutical injustice, as defined by Fricker, is the injustice of having a significant portion of one's social experience be ineffable to the collective understanding due to a lack of reliable hermeneutical resources through which to communicate the experience. This is *always* a form of powerlessness, whether structural or one-off -- it is not something that one can opt-out of being (otherwise, it should not be considered hermeneutical injustice). Fricker describes this as a thwarted epistemic agent who is not believed or cannot make sense of her world (Pohlhaus, 716), specifically due to hermeneutical marginalization: \"an unequal participation in meaning-generating practices pertaining to some areas of the social world that is the result of subordination in or exclusion from those practices\" (Fricker 2007, 153-54)\n\nWilful hermeneutical ignorance, on the other hand is a situation where dominantly situated knower continue engaging in the world while refusing to learn to use epistemic resources developed from knowers who are marginally situated. Specifically, wilful hermeneutical ignorance posits that the *sociality* of the marginally situated knower is epistemically significant through two forms 1) situatedness (the knower's social position draws their attention to particular aspects of the world) and 2) interdependence (epistemic resources are, by nature, collective). In the example given by Polhaus where she references the jurors in *To Kill a Mockingbird*, she declares that the \"jurors are culpable as since there is nothing forcing them to use faulty epistemic resources.\" Polhaus notes here that being marginally situated does not lead to \"different\" knowledge, but rather as Harding argued, actually more *objective* knowledge (Harding 1991, 138-163). The inferences that the juror *should* have drawn are unavailable to them because they use epistemic resources that distort how they experience the world and prevent them from rationally understanding how Robinson could have acted the way he did. The *wilful* part comes from the fact that while the dominantly situated knower cannot step outside of their situatedness, they *can* learn to use epistemic resources developed from the experiences of marginalized knowers (much like Atticus Finch does).\n\nWe examine the example the Fricker provides us in *Epistemic Injustice* as an example of hermeneutical injustice but not wilful hermeneutical ignorance. In this case study, the woman in question is Wendy Sanford who is dealing with post-partum depression around the loss of her son. Clearly, in the case provided, she was not aware of the term post-partum depression and had no way to describe this integral part of her social experience. However, upon learning this, it was a hermeneutical breakthrough for her -- as if a \"hermeneutical darkness that suddenly lifted from Wendy Sandford's mind\" which had prevented her from properly understanding her experience. Then, according to Fricker, before realizing the term for her depression, she was \"a thwarted epistemic agent who could not make sense of this aspect of her social experience\" which falls under hermeneutical injustice.\n\nHowever, it is *not* wilful hermeneutical injustice as there is no *other* that is being wilfully ignorant here. Wilful ignorance requires one party or the system to actively forgo good epistemic resources for faulty epistemic resources, which is not the case here. Clearly, Wendy tries to grasp for epistemic resources to explain her social experience through workshops on women's medical and sexual issues.\n\n\u003e In that one forty-five-minute period, I realized that what I'd been blaming myself for, and what my husband had blamed me for, wasn't my personal deficiency. It was a combination of physiological things and a real societal thing, isolation.",

This requires good understanding of human psychology, technology, and good communication (both person-to-person and person-to-machine).\n\n\u003e HCD principle is to avoid specifying the problem as long as possible but instead to iterate upon repeated approximations.\n\n### Importance of user involvement\nInvolving users helps with expectation management\n-   can see capabilities from an early stage\n-   understand better how it will affect their jobs/lives and why the features are designed that way\n\n### Discoverability\nWhen we interact with a product, we need to figure out how to work it. This means discovering what it does, how it works, and what operations are possible.\n\nThis is composed up of 5 fundamental psychological concepts which are the principles of interaction:\n1. **Affordances**:  signifies *what* action is possible. It is the relationship between the properties of an objects and the capabilities of the user that determine how the object could be used. For example, a chair affords (\"is for\") support and therefore affords sitting. If an affordance or anti-affordance cannot be perceived, some means of signaling its presence is required.\n2. **Signifiers**: signifies *where* actions should occur. A mark, sound, or perceivable indicator that communicates appropriate behaviour to a person. Can be a [desire paths](thoughts/desire%20paths.md), a push/pull label, etc. However, we shuld be aware that different cultures associate different meanings with different signifiers.\n3. **Constraints**: limits to the possible interactions with an object. For example, the different sized holes in a scissor suggests different numbers of fingers may fit in each hole and not any more.\n4. **Mappings**: relationship between the elements of two sets of things. For example, a mapping of light switches to light bulbs or the steering wheel to the direction of the wheels. Groupings and proximity are important principles from Gestalt psychology that can be used to map controls to function: related controls should be grouped together. \n5. **Feedback**: communicating the results of an action or some way of letting you know that the system is working on your request. Has to be a balance, little and poor feedback and too much feedback can also be unhelpful and annoying to users. Feedback is essential, but not when it gets in the way of other things, including a calm and relaxing environment.",

    "content": "\nEverything is in the mind. The intrinsic nature of ultimate reality is the mind.\n\n## Pratyabhijna Self-awareness\nOn [[thoughts/self-knowledge|Self-knowledge]]\n\nNondual Śaiva philosophical tradition concerned with articulating and defending the idea that everything is Śiva, as well as the practices that lead to this realization\n\nA form of Cosmopsychism which is in turn a form of [[thoughts/ontology|ontological]] idealism\n\n- Ultimate Reality (Śiva)\n\t- Consciousness as the infinite potential for any and all manifest worlds\n\t- Śiva is like a sculptor, a playwright, or a yogin because he spontaneously creates worlds from within himself\n- Conventional Reality\n\t- Embodied worlds created through exclusion\n\t- Manifests because the ultimate desires to experience itself in diverse  forms\n\t- When we imagine, for example, an elephant, our consciousness presents this object ('this') as distinct from our conscious selves ('I'). Despite this distinction, we know 'this' is only imagined and arises from [the self](thoughts/the%20Self.md).\n\t- Consciousness, when this happens, does not become the elephant, nor does it cease to exist as the 'I' when taking on the elephant's form, it simplify manifests itself as something distinct from the 'this'.\n\t- This plasticity is what the Śaivas call \"freedom\"\n- Internality is the reflective awareness 'I', externality is the reflective awareness 'this'\n\t- For objects perceived there are two kinds of externality\n\t\t1. Object of cognition through the external sense\n\t\t2. Object of cognition through the internal sense\n- No ontologically independent external objects\n\t- The internal self must have the notion or essence of object to manifest it as external (?)\n\t- Cannot infer the existence of something that has never been perceived \n\nHas many holes in its axioms but again presented here just to learn:\n1. Intrinsic Existence: consciousness must exist from its own intrinsic perspective, independent of external observers\n2. Composition: consciousness is structured and composed of multiple phenomenological distinctions (elementary or higher order)\n3. Information: consciousness is specific. Each experience is particular and uniquely distinct\n4. Integration: consciousness is unified. Each experience is irreducible and cannot be subdivided into non-interdependent disjoint subsets of phenomenal distinctions\n5. Exclusion: consciousness is definite -- it either has or does not have certain phenomenal distinctions\n\nArgument\n1. We observe causally specific differentiation in our everyday world\n2. Something that is causally specific must be the effect of a specific real cause\n3. Each real cause produces only the effects that are in accord with its nature\n4. Such causes must be either internal or external to consciousness\n5. These causes cannot be external to consciousness because, per Vasubandhu and Dharmakīrti, external objects are irrelevant and logically incoherent\n6. These causes therefore must be internal to consciousness\n7. It is not the nature of something undifferentiated to produce different effects\n8. Consciousness cannot be totally undifferentiated and produce different effects\n9. Consciousness must be inherently differentiated if it is to account for the differentiated awarenesses observed in the conventional world\n10. Since there is no other viable candidate for the cause of this differentiation, the nature of reality is ultimate consciousness that inherently contains the capacity for the expression of all differentiated awarenesses\n\n'Ill-taught' people satisfy themselves with conventional reality call it 'inert', failing to see it is a subset of Śiva. \"Only consciousness can present itself as precisely what it’s not while still remaining itself\"\n\n### The memory argument against Vijñānavādin Buddhists in Utpaladeva’s Pratyabhijñā Corpus\n1. Utpaladeva does not believe that awareness can become an object of another distinct awareness\n2. Memory involves an awareness-event being the object of another awareness-event\n3. Memory thus is impossible unless they're actually part of the same overall awareness (e.g. Śiva)",

    "content": "\n## Image Formation, Cameras, and Lenses\nImage formation depends on\n1. Lighting conditions\n2. Scene geometry\n3. Surface properties\n4. Camera optics\n5. Sensor properties\n\n### Image Processing Pipeline\nThe sequence of image processing operations applied by the camera's image signal processor (ISP) to convert a RAW image into a regular JPG/PNG.\n\n1. Lens\n2. CFA\n3. Analog Front-end -\u003e RAW image (mosaiced, linear, 12-bit)\n4. White balance\n5. CFA demoisaicing\n6. Denoising\n7. Colour transforms\n8. Tone reproduction\n9. Compression -\u003e final RGB image (non-linear, 8-bit)\n\n### Examples\n#### Reflection\nSurface reflection depends on viewing $(\\theta_v,\\phi_v)$ and illumination $(\\theta_i,\\phi_i)$ direction along with the Bidirectional Reflection Distribution Function: $BRDF(\\theta_v,\\phi_v,\\theta_i,\\phi_i) = \\frac{\\rho_d}{\\pi}$\n\nAll angles are spherical coordinates w.r.t. the normal line of the surface.\n\nA Lambertian (matte) surface is one which appears the same brightness from all directions. A mirror (specular) surface is one where all incident light is reflected in one direction $(\\theta_v,\\phi_v)=(\\theta_r,\\phi_r)$\n\n#### Cameras\n![Bare-sensor imaging](/thoughts/images/bare-sensor-imaging.png)*All scene points contribute to all sensor pixels*\n\nAs a result, the image is really blurry.\n\n![Pinhole camera](/thoughts/images/pinhole.png)*Pinhole camera*\n\nThe image here is flipped, but no longer blurry. Roughly, each scene point contributes to one sensor. Pinhole camera means you need to get the right size of pinhole. If the pinhole is too big, then many directions are averaged, blurring the image. If the pinhole is too small, then diffraction becomes a factor, also blurring the image.\n\nA few perspective 'tricks' arise out of the pinhole\n1. Size is inversely proportional to distance\n2. Parallel lines meet at a point (vanishing point on the horizon)\n\nSide note, pinhole cameras are really slow because only a small amount of light actually makes it through the pinhole. As a result, we have lenses\n\n#### Lenses\nThe role of a lens is to capture more light while preserving, as much as possible, the abstraction of an ideal pinhole camera, the thin lens equation\n\n$$\\frac{1}{z'} - \\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{1}{f}$$\n\nwhere $f$ is the focal point, $z'$ is the distance to the image plane, and $z$ is the distance to the object.\n\nFocal length can be thought of as the distance behind the lens where incoming rays parallel to the optical axis converge to a single point.\n\nDifferent effects can be explained using physics phenomena. Vignettes are simply light that reaches one lens but not the other in a compound lens. Chromatic aberration happens because the index of refraction depends on wavelength of the light so not all colours can be in equal focus.\n\nSimilarities with the human eye\n- pupil is analogous to the pinhole/aperture\n- retina is analogous to the film/digital sensor\n\n#### Weak Perspective\nOnly accurate when object is small/distant. Useful for recognition\n\n$$P = \\begin{bmatrix}x \\\\ y \\\\ z\\end{bmatrix} \\textrm{projects to a 2D image point} \\ P' = \\begin{bmatrix}x' \\\\ y'\\end{bmatrix} \\textrm{where} \\ m = \\frac{f'}{z_0}, x' = mx, y' = my$$\n\n\n#### Orthographic Projection\n\n$$P = \\begin{bmatrix}x \\\\ y \\\\ z\\end{bmatrix} \\textrm{projects to a 2D image point} \\ P' = \\begin{bmatrix}x' \\\\ y'\\end{bmatrix} \\textrm{where} \\ x' = x, y' = y$$\n\n#### Perspective Projection\n\n$$P = \\begin{bmatrix}x \\\\ y \\\\ z\\end{bmatrix} \\textrm{projects to a 2D image point} \\ P' = \\begin{bmatrix}x' \\\\ y'\\end{bmatrix} \\textrm{where} \\ m = \\frac{f'}{z_0}, x' = f'\\frac{x}{z}, y' = f'\\frac{y}{z}$$\n\n## Image as functions\n### Grayscale images\n2D function $I(x,y)$ where the domain is $(x,y) \\in ([1, width], [1, height])$ and the range is $I(x,y) \\in [0, 255] \\in \\mathbb{Z}$\n\n### Point Processing\nApply a single mathematical operation to each individual pixel\n\n## Linear Filters\nLet $I(x,y)$ be an $n \\times n$ digital image. Let $F(x,y)$ be the $m \\times m$ filter or kernel. For convenience, assume $m$ is odd and $m \u003c n$. Let $k = \\lfloor \\frac{m}{2} \\rfloor$, we call $k$ the half-width.\n\nFor a correlation, we then compute the new image $I'(x,y)$ as follows:\n$$I'(x,y) = \\sum_{j=-k}^k\\sum_{i=-k}^k F(i, j) I(x + i, y + j)$$\n\nFor a convolution, we then compute the new image $I'(x,y)$ as follows:\n$$I'(x,y) = \\sum_{j=-k}^k\\sum_{i=-k}^k F(i, j) I(x - i, y - j)$$\n\nA convolution is just the correlation with the filter rotated 180 degrees. We denote a convolution with the $\\otimes$ symbol.\n\nIn general,\n1. Correlation: measures similarity between two signals. In our case, this would mean similarity between a filter and an image patch it is being applied to\n2. Convolution: measures the effect one signal has on another signal\n\nEach pixel in the output image is a linear combination of the central pixel and its neighbouring pixels in the original image. This results in $m^2 \\times n^2$ computations. When $m \\approx n$, then this is a $\\mathcal{O}(n^4)$\n\nLow pass filters filter out high frequences, high pass filters filter out low frequencies.\n\n### Properties of Linear Filters\n1. Superposition: distributive law applies to convolution. Let $F_1$ and $F_2$ be digital filters. Then $$(F_1 + F_2) \\otimes I(x,y) = F_1 \\otimes I(x,y) + F_2 \\otimes I(x,y)$$\n2. Scaling. Let $F$ be a digital filter and let $k$ be a scalar. $$(kF) \\otimes I(x,y) = F \\otimes (kI(x,y)) = k(F \\otimes I(x,y))$$\n3. Shift invariance: output is local (doesn't depend on absolute position in image)\n\n**Characterization Theorem**: Any operation is linear if it satisfies both superposition and scaling. Any linear, shift-invariant operation can be expressed as a convolution.\n\n#### Properties of Convolution\n1. Associative. $G \\otimes (F \\otimes I(x,y)) = (G \\otimes F) \\otimes I(x,y)$\n2. Symmetric. $(G \\otimes F) \\otimes I(x,y) = (F \\otimes G) \\otimes I(x,y)$\n\nCorrelation, on the other hand, is generally not associative.\n\nFor 1D Gaussians, we note $G_{\\sigma_1}(x) \\otimes G_{\\sigma_2}(x) = G_{\\sqrt{\\sigma_1^2 + \\sigma_2^2}}(x)$. Convolving with $G_\\sigma(x) \\otimes G_\\sigma(x) = G_{\\sqrt 2 \\sigma}(x)$\n\n### Boundary Effects\n1. Ignore these locations: make the computation undefined for the outsize $k$ rows/columns\n2. Pad with zeroes: return zero whenever of value of $I$ is required at some position outside the image\n3. Assume periodicity: wrap image around\n4. Reflect border\n\n### Pillbox\nA 2D pillbox is rotationally invariant but not separable\n\n$$f(x,y) = \\frac{1}{\\pi r^2}\n\\begin{cases} \n  1 \u0026 \\textrm{if} x^2 + y^2 \\leq r^2 \\\\\n  0 \u0026 \\textrm{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nAn efficient implementation would represent a 2D box filter as the sum of a 2D pillbox and some \"extra corner bits\"\n\n### Gaussian Filters\n- Box filter doesn't apply well for lens defocus. A circular pillbox is a much better model for defocus\n- Gaussian is a good general smoothing model\n  - for phenomena\n  - whenever the CLT applies\n\nGaussian filters are rotationally invariant.\n\nWe get $G_\\sigma(x,y) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sigma^2}\\exp^{-\\frac{x^2+y^2}{2\\sigma^2}}$ where $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation\n\nFor a 3x3, we then need to quantize and truncate it, evaluating $G_\\sigma(x,y)$ wherever in the filter. Increasing $\\sigma$ means more blur. Problem with 3x3 is that it truncates too much of the distribution (does not sum up to one), this can cause unintentional darkening.\n\nIn general, the Gaussian filter should capture $\\pm3\\sigma$ for $\\sigma = 1$ which gives us a 7x7 filter.\n\n#### Efficiency\nAs both the 2D box filter and 2D Gaussian filter are separable, it can be implemented as two 1D convolutions which convolve each row and then each column separately.\n\nA 2D filter is separable if it can be expressed as an outer product of two 1D filters\n\nA seperable 2D Gaussian only does $2m$ multiplications at each pixel (one for each 1D filter). Considering the image has $n \\times n$ pixels, then this is a $2m \\times n^2$ multiplications. Assuming $m \\approx n$, this is $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$\n\n#### Fourier Transform\nThe basic building block of the fourier transform is the periodic function.\n\n$$Asin(\\omega x + \\phi)$$\n\nwhere $A$ is the amplitude, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency and $\\phi$ is the phase. Fourier's claim was that you could add enough of these to get any periodic signal!\n\n### The Convolution Theorem\nLet $i'(x,y) = f(x,y) \\otimes i(x,y)$ be the convolution.\n\nThen, $\\mathcal{I}'(w_x,w_y) = \\mathcal{F}(w_x,w_y)\\mathcal{I}(w_x,w_y)$ which is just a simple element-wise multiplication after applying a Fourier transform to each.\n\nAt the expense of two Fourier transforms and one inverse Fourier transform, convolution can be reduced to (complex) multiplication. This speeds up the cost of FFT/IFFT for the image and filter to $\\mathcal{O}(n^2\\log n)$ and $\\mathcal{O}(m^2\\log m)$ respectively, dropping the total cost of convolution to $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$\n\n### Convolution Sizing\nConvolving two filters of size $m \\times m$ and $n \\times n$ results in a filter of size\n\n$$(n + 2 \\lfloor \\frac m 2 \\rfloor) \\times (n + 2 \\lfloor \\frac m 2 \\rfloor)$$\n\nMore broadly for a set of $K$ filters of sizes $m_k \\times m_k$ the resulting filter will have size \n\n$$(m_1 + 2 \\sum_{k=2}^K \\lfloor \\frac{m_k}{2} \\rfloor) \\times (m_1 + 2 \\sum_{k=2}^K \\lfloor \\frac{m_k}{2} \\rfloor)$$\n\n## Non-linear filters\n- Median Filter (take the median value of the pixels under the filter), effective at reducing certain kinds of noise, such as impulse noise ('salt and pepper' noise or 'shot' noise)\n- Bilateral Filter (edge-preserving filter). Effectively smooths out the image but keeps the sharp edges, good for denoising. Weights of neighbour at a spacial offset $(x,y)$ from the center pixel $I(X,Y)$ given by a product $\\exp^{-\\frac{x^2+y^2}{2\\sigma_d^2}}\\exp^{-\\frac{(I(X+x, Y+y) - I(X,Y))^2}{2\\sigma_r^2}}$. We call the first half of the product the *domain kernel* (which is essentially a Gaussian) and the second half the *range kernel* (which depends on location in the image).\n- ReLU. $x$ for all $x \u003e 0$, $0$ otherwise.\n\n## Sampling\nImages are a discrete (read: sampled) representation of a continuous world.\n\nAn image suggests a 2D surface which can be grayscale or colour. We note that in the continuous case that \n\n$i(x,y)$ is a real-valued function of real spatial variables, $x$ and $y$. It is bounded above and below, meaning $0 \\leq i(x,y) \\leq M$ where $M$ is the maximum brightness. It is bounded in extent, meaning that $x$ and $y$ do not span the entirety of the reals.\n\nImages can also be considered a function of time. Then, we write $i(x,y,t)$ where $t$ is the temporal variable. We can also explicitly state the dependence of brightness on wavelength explicit, $i(x,y,t,\\lambda)$ where $\\lambda$ is a spectral variable.\n\nWe denote the discrete image with a capital I as $I(x,y)$. So when we go from continuous to discrete, how do we sample?\n- Point sampling is useful for theoretical development\n- Area-based sampling occurs in practice\n\nWe also quantize the brightness into a finite number of equivalence classes. These values are called gray-levels\n\n$$I(x,y) \\implies \\lfloor \\frac{i(x,y)}{M} (2^n - 1) + 0.5\\rfloor$$\n\nTypically, $n=8$ giving us $0 \\leq n \\leq 256$\n\nIs it possible to recover $i(x,y)$ from $I(x,y)$? In the case when the continuous is equal to the discrete, this is possible (e.g. a completely flat image). However, if there is a discontinuouty that doesn't fall at a precise integer, we cannot recover the original continuous image.\n\nA bandlimit is the maximum *spatial frequency* of an image. The audio equivalent of this is audio frequency, the upper limit of human hearing is about 20kHz which is the human hearing bandlimit.\n\nAliasing is the idea that we don't have have enough samples to properly reconstruct the original signal so we construct a lower frequency (fidelity) version.\n\nWe can reduce aliasing artifacts by doing\n1. Oversampling: sample more than you think you need and average\n2. Smoothing before sampling: reduce image frequency\n\nThis creates funky patterns on discrete images called moire patterns. This happens in film too (temporal aliasing), this is why wheels sometimes look like they go backwards.\n\nThe fundamental result (Sampling Theorem): For bandlimited signals, if you sample regularly at or above twice the maximum frequency (called the Nyquist Rate), then you can reconstruct the original signal exactly.\n\n- Oversampling: nothing bad happens! Just wasted bits.\n- Undersampling: things are missing and there are artifacts (things that shouldn't be there)\n\n### Shrinking Images\nWe can't shrink an image simply by taking every second pixel\n\nArtifacts will appear:\n1. Small phenomena can look bigger (moire patterns in checkerboards and striped shirts)\n2. Fast phenomena can look slower (wagon wheels rolling the wrong way)\n\nWe can sub-sample by using Gaussian pre-filtering (Gaussian blur first then throw away every other column/row). Practically, for ever image reduction of a half, smooth by $\\sigma = 1$\n",

    "content": "\n## Your Brain on Groups\nEzra Klein in *Why We're Polarized*\n\n\u003e The most important principle of the subjective social order we construct for ourselves is the classification of groups as 'we' and 'they'. Once someone has become a 'they' we are used to dismissing them, competing against them, discriminating against them even if there is no reason for it in terms of our own interests (Tajfel)\n\nHistorically, people have nurtured their prejudices as they believed they reflected reality -- we disliked those we disliked because we had reason to dislike them\n\n### Tajfel's Experiement\n- 64 boys between the age of 14 and 15 all from the same school knowing one another already\n- Sorted into two groups arbitrarily based off some previous shared experience (in this case, 'performance' on a dot estimation test)\n- Tajfel expected no intergroup behaviour as he wanted a baseline yet, even this test showed group identity taking hold and mutating into bias\n- In fact, far from behaviour showing a pure desire to maximize their group's gains, they often gave their group less to increase the difference between them and the out-group\n\nHuman beings evolved to exist in groups. To be part of a group and to see that group thrive meant survival. To be exiled from a group, or to see your group crushed by its enemies, could mean death. Is it really so strange that we evolved to feel the life-and-death stakes of group belonging and status?\n\nPolitics is a team sport\n- \"the behaviour of partisans resembles that of sports team members acting to preserve the status of their teams rather than thoughtful citizens participating in the political process for the broader good\"\n- When people spend endless hours volunteering, planting yard signs, writing checks, what is likely foremost in their minds is that they are furious with the opposing party and want intensely to avoid losing to it -- not a specific issue agenda\n- In *Open versus Closed*\n\t- The least-engaged voters tend to look at politics through the lens of material self-interest \"what will this policy do for me?\"\n\t- The most-engaged look at politics through the lens of identity \"what does support for this policy position say about me?\"\n- Our political identities are not our only identities: polarization is about which identities get activated\n\t- The problem with increasing polarization is that a single vote can now \"indicate a person's partisan perference as well as his or her religion, race, ethnicity, gender, neighbourhood, and favourite grocery story.\" This is no longer a single social identity, partisanship is now a mega-identity\n- Iyengar: \"Political identity is fair game for hatred. Racial identity is not. Gender identity is not.\"\n- Bipartisan cooperation is often necessary for governance but irrational for the minority party to offer\n\n## Ingroup/outgroup bias\n-   get social status points\n-   we will choose to identify with whatever in-group will immediately benefit us the most\n-   why sororities + frats are successful → sunk cost fallacy\n-   amount of boundaries required → well organized events vs serendipitous interactions\n\t-   do serendipitous interactions only come from [ephemereal content](thoughts/ephemereal%20content.md)?",

    "content": "\n\u003e Anirvacanīyatva or indeterminancy\n\nVācaspati Miśra's *Bhāmatī*, a commentary on Śamkara's *Brahmasū-trabhāsya*.\n\nIn this chapter/section, objects of erroneous cognition are used to show how the world as it is experienced can neither be denied an independent status nor established as having one. The key idea is the 'indeterminate' state as to their ontological status.\n\nVācaspati does not doubt the correctness of the [Nyāya](thoughts/Nyāya.md) argument for [philosophical realism](thoughts/philosophical%20realism.md) but more so its completeness. I have cognition of a white horse, not of 'white' and of 'horse'. Vācaspati argues that the sum is greater than the whole -- it is not sufficient that a description of its constituent elements ('this' and 'silver') entirely constitute the unitary object of cognition ('this is silver').\n\n## Cognition-Object relationship\nThe cognition-object relationship here refers to one about [representational](thoughts/representation.md) content.\n\nRepresentation, in this context, means a cognitive state of being 'of' or 'about' the object. Important to note that, in this translation, representation is neutral to theories of perception\n\nExample case where a cognition (thought) is a thought of a specific object\n1. Object gives content (visayatā) to a cognition in the sense it is the subject of the thought and therefore individuates/gives identity to/specifies that cognition\n2. The cognition is then a representation (visayitā) of the object\n\nThe form usually is 'this thing is a shell' which is in the form of $F\\alpha$ where\n- $\\alpha$ is the object ('this thing', dharmin, qualificand, thing being distinguished)\n- $F$ is what it is cognised as (the concept, content of thought, dharma, the distinguisher)\n- Akin to the [Twin Earth Argument](thoughts/Twin%20Earth%20Argument.md), \"this\" can refer to different things\n\t- Like variable naming in programming languages where unification would not unify two 'this' from different scopes\n\n[[thoughts/ontology|Ontologies]] are theories of objects -- a conception of what the world is made up of. Ontologies need to be *interpreted*\n\n## Erroneous Cognition\n- A cognition is valid if it discriminates between that object and all others.\n- Discrimination is correct identification.\n- Erroneous cognition occurs when the subject takes it to be true when it is not.\n- Sublation is the incidence of a later cognition that results in the realization of an earlier cognition being erroneous.\n\nEpistemic indistinguishability: there is no perceived difference between contents of distinct cognitions (i.e. confusing 'this is shell' with 'this is silver')\n\nLet us take the simple perceptual demonstrative judgement of the form 'this is a piece of silver'. This can clearly be a wrong judgement as the relevant object could be a piece of shell.\n\nWhat does an erroneous cognition say about its object (if anything at all)?\n\nWell, this states that object and concept must *both* exist. Even in mistaking the shell of the silver, both shell (instantiated as physical demonstrated object) and silver (instantiated as primary object of cognition) exist. TLDR; erroneous cognition required determinate objects in the determinate world.\n\nThe state of taking 'this' to be silver is not explained simply by explaining that 'this' and 'silver' occur in it. Take for example, the non-erroneous cognition 'this looks like silver' which contains both constituent elements but is epistemically different from the earlier erroneous claim of 'this is silver'.\n\nSo how does an erroneous cognition $G\\alpha$ arise?\n1. Suppose the subject knows when the distinguisher $G$ is valid\n2. $G$ is not necessarily true given the conditions at hand may not be as remembered compared to the conditions under which $G$-identification was last true (temporally different).\n3. It is true that $G\\beta$ where $\\beta$ is a piece of silver at some point in the past\n4. It is true that $\\alpha$ exists\n5. It is false that $G\\alpha$\n6. It is false that $\\alpha$ is perceived as $\\beta$\nThe erroneous cognition arises when the subject believes 5 and 6 to be true instead.\n\nThe question then becomes, what is the object $\\alpha$ that is being individuated here?\n\nFirst, let $F$ and $G$ be incompatible (read: mutually exclusive) qualifiers. That is, if $F\\alpha$ then $\\lnot G\\alpha$ and vice versa.\n\nAdvaitin makes two contradictory conclusions here\n1. Utilizes P1: asserting that an object exists requires there to be a cognition with that object as its content through *pramānas*. Concludes that $G\\alpha$ cannot exist.\n2. Utilizes P2: what doesn't exist must not be the content of any cognition as it is not experienced as all. Concludes that $G\\alpha$ exists.\n\nBoth P1 and P2 rely on relevant (and fairly uncontroversial principles) to come to contradictory results. This argument shows that there is no way of assigning status to $G\\alpha$ and thus indeterminant.\n\n---\n\n## Essay\n\u003e Ram-Prasad summarizes Vācaspati's argument concerning indeterminacy as follows: \"while it is possible to determine the existential status of objects of cognition (and thereby determine the validity or invalidity of particular cognitions), it is indeterminate as to whether objects as a whole are, independently of particular cognitions of them, existent or not\" (118). Unpack this argument. You can focus on the material that Ram-Prasad covers in p. 113-118 (Section 7 and Section 8). Note that \"unpack\" here is just asking you to explain the argument. You don't have to give an evaluation of whether or not it's successful this time.\n\nLet us break this argument down into constituent parts and tackle them piece by piece. \n\nA: *It is possible to determine the existential status of objects of cognition*.\n\nWe first define some terminology. The cognition-object relationship here refers to one about representational content. Representation, in this context, means a cognitive state of being 'of' or 'about' the object. Ram-Prasad uses a specific notation to express these relations:\n- $\\alpha$ is the object of cognition ('this thing', qualificand, thing being distinguished)\n- $F$ is what it is cognised as (the concept, content of thought, the distinguisher)\nHere, Vācaspati does *not* disagree with [Nyāya](thoughts/Nyāya.md) in terms of recognizing objects of cognition as existing independently of consciousness.\n\nB: The second part posits that A implies the ability to *determine the validity or invalidity of particular cognitions.\n\nTo use more of Ram-Prasad's notation, let the object at at hand ('this') be $\\alpha$ and what it is cognised as ('silver') be $F$. The resulting cognition is of form $F\\alpha$. This resulting cognition is a demonstrative, grounded in reference to a \"spatio-temporally indexed object\" and is 'valid' until sublated by subsequent cognition.\n\nHowever, let us consider the 'invalid' case. Let us take the simple perceptual demonstrative judgement of the form 'this is a piece of silver'. This can clearly be a wrong judgement as the relevant object could be a piece of shell. In more formal terms, if the cognition is actually $G\\alpha$ (this is a piece of silver), then $F\\alpha$ would be invalid as each object is *uniquely* distinguished by its distinguisher.\n\nYet, even in mistaking the shell of the silver, both shell (instantiated as physical demonstrated object) and silver (instantiated as primary object of cognition) exist. Erroneous cognition still require determinate objects in the determinate world.\n\nC: Finally, the argument concludes that A and B combined do not allow us to conclude *whether objects as a whole are, independently of particular cognitions of them, existent or not*.\n\nFor this argument, Ram-Prasad refers to Advaitin's seemingly contradictory conclusions which arise from fairly uncontroversial principles (P1 and P2 in the text):\n1. Utilizes P1: asserting that an object exists requires there to be a cognition with that object as its content through *pramānas*. Eventually concludes that $G\\alpha$ cannot exist.\n2. Utilizes P2: what doesn't exist must not be the content of any cognition as it is not experienced as all. Eventually concludes that $G\\alpha$ exists.\nThis argument shows that there is no way of assigning status to $G\\alpha$ and thus the cognition is indeterminant.\n\nExtending this to the world, we use the differences between third and first person accounts of erroneous cognition. The distinguishing characteristic of third person accounts is that the third person's determination of what [[thoughts/causality|causal]] elements were involved in the erroneous cognition of the subject is true. However, this is not guaranteed to hold.\n\nA valid cognition is discriminating, but that is determined only by the judgement of another cognition. In a sense, every cognition requires a third-person account. Yet, we know that every third-person account itself is a first-person cognition merely presuming its validity, no independent judgement as to the truth of the original cognition is possible. We know that whether a cognition is veridical or erroneous is to show whether its object exists or not. As this cannot be done, Ram-Prasad concludes that the existence of the object as a whole is indeterminant.",

We may have access to more of it, but it’s not obvious that this is better—just different.\n\n\u003e While technology has changed the volume, pace, and sources of information in our daily lives, it has not changed its essential power to shape our knowledge and our behavior in the world.\n\nInformation fuels discovery. It enables us to build off of each others work, and accomplish more than what a [single person could](posts/collaborative-thinking.md).\n\nInformation organizes us.

Providing scientific articles to those at elite universities in the First World, but not to children in the Global South? It’s outrageous and unacceptable. . . . We can fight back. Those with access to these resources—students, librarians, scientists—you have been given a privilege. You get to feed at this banquet of knowledge while the rest of the world is locked out.

Tokenization (how do we turn text into tokens?). However, we need to be wary of edge cases like hyphenation, punctutation, abbreviations, numbers, etc.\n2. Stopword removal (removing words that occur very frequently but don't contribute very much to overall meaning of sentence). However, we need to be wary of creating new phrases that never existed and removal of entire phrases (e.g. 'to be or not to be')\n3. Conflation and stemming (recall enhancing technique that takes different forms of words and replaces them by a single form). Example stemmers include Porter and Krovetz stemmers (difference is that Krovetz is more conservative, only stems to words in a dictionary). However, this can reduce precision when stemming results in incorrect words.\n4. Term weights (which terms are the most important? One common approach is to use term frequency between documents -- sometimes called Document Frequency or DF. The larger the DF, the less useful it is to discriminate between two documents. Measure of importance then is the inverse document frequency. The most common measure is term frequency multiplied by inverse document frequency $TF \\times IDF$)\n\n### Catalog\nCatalogs allow for retrieval by simple matching whereby the user has an index term in mind and can then find all items that are indexed by that term.\n\nBy its nature, the catalog is divided, and the subject catalog is on its own.

As a result, 'interactiveness' was more of an afterthought and relegated to the peripheral.\n\n### Cranfield experiments\n#### Cranfield 1\nFeatured\n- Universal Decimal Classification (UDC): mostly empirically derived for what works best\n- Alphabetical\n- Faceted classification\n- Uniterm system of co-ordinate indexing (allowed boolean AND queries)\n\nIn failure analysis, only 1 in 20 failures were the result of the indexing systems themselves. Majority was human error in either the indexing, searching, or clerical processes of preparing the catalogues. Cleverdon then concluded what then must matter is the underlying document representation.\n\n## Early information retrieval systems\nMostly 'batch', non-interactive 'closed stack' systems.\n\n### Walker (1971)\n\u003e A key difference in interactive terminal search is that data is brought to the searcher rather than the searcher going to the data\n\nCreating an online system as an access point for databases. However, these information retrieval systems required substantial knowledge not only of the characteristics of the database and its indexing systems but also of the details of the query language, boolean algebra for effective queries, and effective techniques for modifying queries given search results. This resulted in a new class of librarians and information scientists -- search intermediaries -- well versed in this new form of information seeking.\n\n5 main filters to forming an effective query\n1. Determining the subject of the information query\n2. Determining the objective/motivation of information-seeking behaviour\n3. Determining the personal characteristics of the inquirer\n4.

Determining anticipated/acceptable answers\n\nThe problem: most people don't actually know the thing they are searching for. \n\n### Savage-Knepshield and Belkin (1999)\nBennet was looking at some very important [HCI](thoughts/human%20computer%20interaction.md) considerations here, esp. w.r.t. the differences between human searcher and its automated counterpart.

Ko*](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/foundations-of-information/#/systems)\n\nInformation Systems are processes that organize people, technology, and data to allow people to create, store, manipulate, distribute, and access information.\n\n**The Great Library of Alexandria** is one of the largest information systems in modern history. It was built in Alexandria, Egypt, and part of a larger research institution called the Mouseion. The idea behind the [library](thoughts/library.md) was to be a universal collection of knowledge.\n\nMany influential philosophers worked at the library in the 2nd and 3rd centuries BC, including Euclid (founder of geometry), Homer (author of epic Greek poems), Plato (founder of the first Western university), and Socrates (founder of Western moral philosophy).\n\nWhy build the ARPANET (precursor to the [Internet](thoughts/Internet.md))?\n1. Explore the area of computer networking research (how to share computing resources)\n2. Sharing resources for research communites (e.g. datasets)\n3. Scaling past the speed of the phoneline (2.4kb/s)\n4. Utility for command and control of various military sites (military-industrial complex)\n\n#### Qualities of information systems\n1. Accuracy: how accurate and truthful is data in the system?\n2. Reliability: how many dependencies does it need? How often do those fail?\n3. Learnability: how many skills do you need to acquire to use it?\n\n\u003e Choosing the best system for a particular task then isn’t just about choosing the latest technology, but carefully understanding the task at hand, and what types of systems might best support",

Occurs across multiple places.\n- Learned: Strangers and outsiders encounter infrastructure as a target object to be learned about. New participants acquire a naturalized familiarity with its objects as they become members.\n- Links with conventions of practices: Infrastructure both shapes and is shaped by the conventions of a community of practice (e.g. the QWERTY keyboard).\n\n[Source: Steps Toward an Ecology of Infrastructure: Design and Access for Large Information Spaces by *Susan Leigh Star and Karen Ruhleder*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/23010792)\n\n## What is infrastructure even?\n-  which came first, the infrastructure or the applications that depend on it?\n-   things that use infrastructure or technology\n    -   in the beginning not much of a distinction\n    -   first tech → language\n        -   how did language arise?\n        -   evolve with each other?\n        -   [language as infrastructure for thought](thoughts/language%20of%20thought.md)\n    -   at a certain complexity level, combinatorial explosion of complexity\n    -   does it grows as [emergent behaviour](thoughts/emergent%20behaviour.md)?\n-   is any infrastructure ever new?\n    -   is [everything derivative?](thoughts/originality.md)\n    -   is thought ever new? or is it recombinatorial\n        -   neuroplasticity of culture and language?\n- \"near-ubiquitous accessibility\" (Carter and Acker)\n- \"infrastructure as potential energy held in suspension\" (Boyer)\n\t- \"infrastructure as congealed labor and expertise, such that an electrical grid represents the entanglement and perpetuation of engineering expertise and also a history of materials science and manufacturing that make available substances such as steel, concrete, ceramic, and silicon\"\n- \"living mediation of what organizes life: the lifeworld of structure\" (Berlant)\n\nDo we need to [define infrastructure](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-04-09/the-meaning-of-infrastructure-is-a-pointless-debate)?\n\n\u003e Thus, infrastructure design requires a more subtle approach: **creating the right [incentives](thoughts/incentives.md), environments, and dependencies to encourage well-being while preserving user autonomy**.\n\nInfrastructure can be [emergent](thoughts/emergent%20behaviour.md)\n\n\"I have admiringly called this the \"Procrastination Principle,\" wherein an elegant network design would not be unduly complicated by attempts to solve every possible problem that one could imagine materializing in the future. We see the [principle at work](http://yupnet.org/zittrain/2008/03/01/chapter-6-the-lessons-of-wikipedia/#27) in Wikipedia, where the initial pitch for it would seem preposterous: 'We can generate a consummately thorough and mostly reliable encyclopedia by allowing anyone in the world to create a new page and anyone else in the world to drop by and revise it.'\"\n\n## Hard and soft infrastructure\nHard infrastructure refers to hard rules and goods (e.g. parks, laws, highways, etc.)\n\nSoft infrastructure is upheld as a social [protocol](thoughts/Protocol.md), an institution whose maintenance relies on dedication and value alignment. More closely related to [social contracts](thoughts/social%20contracts.md)\n\n## Post-destruction\n*To oblivion and beyond: Imagining infrastructure after collapse*\n\nAn alternate take on [creation vs maintenance](thoughts/creation%20vs%20maintenance.md)\n\nInfrastructures do not function forever. Like everything else, they lose in the universe's constant battle against entropy.\n\nAs Boyer (2016) argues, infrastructures possess a temporal persistence that “points deathward.” Oil refineries along the Texas Gulf Coast, for example, take part in a system of resource extraction that hastens climate change; at the same time, climate change threatens the continued functioning of these refineries, and oil companies have requested federal funds to protect their facilities from the destructive environmental phenomena that they have a hand in creating (Associated Press, 2018).\n\n- Cruel optimism: the experience of placing hope in an object that perpetually prevents the realization of that hope\n- Angry optimism: \"does not attempt to escape or control the dangers of the present or to return to the comforts of the past but instead looks forward to the possibilities of a time beyond these\"\n\nNot just maintenance, but rebuilding. In the context of infrastructure and collapse, cruel optimism is the belief that rebuilding is a way to heal. \"Breakdown might instead represent an opportunity to create futures that do not resemble the past.\"\n\nLifetime of an infrastructure doesn't just cover its functional lifespan. Many components to this:\n1. Service life (assuming ongoing maintenance, duration of functionality)\n\t1. Risk analysis and modelling is one way of calculating thius\n2. Material life (how long will it take for the material of the infrastructure itself to degrade and erode)\n\nIn fact, for the vast majority of infrastructures, the material life of an infrastructure will far outlast its service life (e.g. concrete aqueducts of the Romans almost 2000 years ago).\n\nRepair, they argue, is just an excuse for returning things to what they used to be rather than see it as a chance for change. Berlant's worry is that the repair of infrastructure merely reinstates a comfortable yet crisis producing past\n\nA new form of utopianism in science [fiction](thoughts/fiction.md): \"if present conditions lead inexorably to collapse, how can that collapse be used as a resource from which to build more equitable ways of life\"\n\n## Commons\n*The commons: Infrastructures for troubling times*\n\n\u003e The common usually refers to an orientation toward life and value unbound by concepts and divisions of property, and points to the world both as a finite resource that is running out and an inexhaustible fund of human consciousness or creativity\n\n*Sensus communis*: \"'common sense' is merely the bourgeois order of truth standing in for the universal, what Stoler calls ‘‘a folk [epistemology](thoughts/epistemology.md).’’\"",

Too much telecommunications work will eventually lead us to building crutches rather than shoes. Stop trying to remedy a perceived defect and instead focus on new functionality\n\n\u003e Go ahead and pick up a book. Open it up to some page. Notice how you _know_ where you are in the book by the distribution of weight in each hand, and the thickness of the page stacks between your fingers. Turn a page, and notice how you would _know_ if you grabbed two pages together, by how they would slip apart when you rub them against each other.\n\n\u003e Take a moment to pick up the objects around you. Use them as you normally would, and sense their tactile response — their texture, pliability, temperature; their distribution of weight; their edges, curves, and ridges; how they _respond_ in your hand as you use them.\n\nCurrent technology is very much just *Pictures Under Glass*.

This quite literally just [interaction failure](thoughts/interaction%20failure.md)\n\n## Beyond Touch\n\n\u003e Humanity is using the dynamic medium merely to emulate and extend static representations from the era of paper.\n\nNew representations of thought — written language, numerals, mathematical notation, data graphics — have been responsible for some of the most significant leaps in the progress of civilization, by expanding humanity’s collectively-thinkable territory. Why then, have we been trapped using the desktop/paper metaphor for the last few centuries? Why have we essentially bottle-necked our [bandwidth](thoughts/bandwidth.md) for interaction design?\n\nTed Nelson, the guy who coined the terms hypertext and hypermedia, called the continued use of paper simulations as \"like tearing the wings off a 747 and driving it as a bus on a highway.\"\n\n\u003e And what about screens as a whole? Is the future of computation really just sliding fingers around slabs of glass? -- [Jason Yuan](https://uxdesign.cc/introducing-mercury-os-f4de45a04289)\n\n[Desktop metaphor](thoughts/desktop%20metaphor.md) was originally designed in 1973 to suit a very different need in computation—the need to mirror digital content with its physical equivalent (thus, the need for folders an documents)\n\nPremise of a lot of the work behind [DynamicLand](http://worrydream.com/cdg/ResearchAgenda-v0.19-poster.pdf) and [Jinha Lee](http://www.leejinha.com/home.html)\n\n\n## Computers in Friendlier Forms\nSource: [Omar Rizwan on Notion Blog](https://www.notion.so/blog/omar)\n\n\u003e If you have objects on your computer, you can have holographic projected versions of them on your desk and then you can suck them into physical objects if you want to physicalize them.

But a toy, it has to be fun to [play](thoughts/play.md) with just because it's fun to play with just from the interactions themselves.\n\nOn physical analogues of software:\n- I think that they're all about trying to take stuff in the computer and give them some of the richness and texture and embodiment of things in the real world and scale also. Where everything on the computer is kind of pristine and closed and perfect and you can't touch it and it doesn't decay, and it all kind of fits in this 11 inch rectangle.\n\n## Modes of Human Communication\nBy upgrading forms of external communication, we can reduce [research debt](thoughts/research%20debt.md) and allow us to [collaborate](posts/collaborative-thinking.md) better\n\n### Conversing (person-to-person)\nFace-to-face, [ephemereal](thoughts/ephemereal%20content.md), improvised. As it stands today, most of this happens through spoken word, hand-waving, and static sketches. This makes grasping the same idea as another person extremely difficult (low [bandwidth](thoughts/bandwidth.md) communication)\n\n\u003e Words are terrible at representing systems\n\nCan we reduce the time to generate models for ideas down from hours to seconds? Is there any way we can integrate the stage into presentations (much like a play)?\n\n### Presenting (person-to-people)\nA lot of this is related to creating good [organizing systems](thoughts/organizing%20system.md)\n\nBlackboards are more flexible than a computer for presentations right now.\n\n\u003e What's the point of a living, dynamic speaker, if the presentation itself is completely static?\n\nCan we create the visuals of a well-polished science YouTube live like a blackboard?\n\nCan we map concept space to physical space and use the stage as an outline of the presentation? Kind of like a book where you can tell how much of it you're finished by the weight of each side, can the audience see what the presenter has already covered?\n\n### Reading/Browsing (media-to-person)\nCan we dynamically create content customizable/personalizable for each user? Are there other channels we can use for communicating information outside just text?\n\nGetting this right is critical for effective [knowledge distillation](thoughts/knowledge%20distillation.md)\n\nIs it possible to create dynamic spatial media? Virtual museums of information? Are there ways to engage with things other than the hands? Can we storytell as a way to ingest and interact with information?\n\n**The focus is on spatial representation of usable knowledge.**\n\nCan we create a [memory palace](thoughts/memory%20palace.md) for people to walk through to recall information and learn new information?\n\n### [Writing](thoughts/writing) (person-to-media)\nAs it stands, writing is just manipulation of symbols. Even for static materials, the symbols just are more literal representations. Coding still, is manipulating indirect [symbolic systems](thoughts/symbolic%20system.md) and [representations](thoughts/representation.md)\n\nCan we show multiple representations of dynamic behaviour? Can we transform between different representations easily?\n\nThe goal is to have manipulation of the behaviour and data itself rather than a structure or set of symbols that 'represents' that behaviour/data -\u003e related to the idea of turtles and the LOGO language in [Mindstorms](thoughts/Mindstorms.md)\n\n### Thinking (person-to-self)\nWhy are almost all representations used in intelletual work (both final product and intermediate scratch work) mostly 2D? Mostly paper or pixels\n\nCan we create dynamic tactile mediums?\n\n\u003e Playfair’s invention of data graphics was transformative because it tapped into capabilities of the human visual system which had gone unused in intellectual work. It may be similarly transformative to tap into the profound capabilities that enable a person to tie a shoelace or make a sandwich, and bring them to bear on more abstract thinking.\n\n\n## Cool Experiments\n1. https://www.robertxiao.ca/research/lumitrack/\n2. https://www.robertxiao.ca/research/desktopography/",

    "content": "\nInteracting with interfaces is complex, and often poorly designed. Most times,\n1. The tasks are implicit and complex: the machine doesn't \"know\" the user's end goal\n2. Interaction is unpredictable and complex: coordination between human and machine is complicated, usage can be unexpected and evolved, users can change their minds\n\n### Interfaces\n1. Functionality Problem: what are the functions this object can perform? Will it do what I want?\n2. Visibility Problem: what mode is this object in? What sequence of controls do I use to get what I want?\n3. Negative Transfer: what would happen if I do what I usually do?\n\n### Designers\nCan fail to\n1. understand the range of users and their limitations\n2. understand contexts of use\n3. communicate what it does, how it works/worked, etc.\n4. start with basic usability needs, and might try to make it exciting or beautiful first\n\n### Market Pressures\nUser's don't always make good purchase choices\n1. Adding new functionality is relatively easy and cheap whereas adding effective controls/feedback is expensive and costly for time and space\n2. Designer time is expensive\n3. Some consumers value cost or looks over usability",

    "content": "\n*Notes for CPSC 317* [(see all notes)](/tags/CPSC317)\n\nThe [Internet](thoughts/Internet.md) is a network of networks. The main goals was to integrate a number of separately  \nadministrated entities into a common entity\n\nSee also: [peer-to-peer](thoughts/peer-to-peer.md), [[thoughts/security|security]]\n\n## Changing an entrenched internet \n[*Enabling a Permanent Revolution in Internet Architecture* by McCauley, Harchol, Panda, Raghavan, and Shenker](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3341302.3342075)\n\nThe current Internet architecture is both inherently flawed (so we should explore radically different alternative designs) and deeply entrenched (so we should restrict ourselves to backwards-compatible and therefore incrementally deployable improvements).\n\nFor example, the decades-long migration effort from [[thoughts/IP Addresses|IPv4 to IPv6]]\n\nTLDR;\n1. Internet architecture is, and will remain, difficult to change -- clean-slate research and projects seem increasingly impossible\n2. Current focus is on backwards-compatible designs that have been tested in large-scale operational networks\n3. OSI model of the internet sees levels below them as 'logical pipes' to get something from place A to B\n\n## Communication\nNecessary conditions\n- A communication medium\n- Source(s) and destination(s)\n- [Protocol](thoughts/Protocol.md) (language)\n- Message\n\n### Circuit Switching\nDedicated path between source and destination. Path taken is determined when connection is established. Single stream of info per path\n\nWorks well when  \n- Guaranteed service is valuable  \n- Demand is steady (unchanging rate)  \n- Starting a new conversation is rare\n\n### Packet Switching\nData is divided in packets that are sent individually where each packet is self contained (contains source, destination, and data) and independently routed.\n\nWorks well when  \n- Statistically good performance is good enough\n- Demand is bursty (rapidly changing rate)\n- Starting a new conversation is frequent\n\n### Multiplexing\nMultiple input streams must share the medium. It must be possible to “demultiplex” at the destination\n\nTypes\n1. Time division multiplexing: each person gets a certain amount of time on the channel\n2. Frequency division multiplexing: each person gets a single frequency band on the channel\n3. Code division multiplexing: combines all messages using a specific code that can be decoded if code is known\n4. Orthogonal multiplexing: a combination of techniques\n\n## Network [Protocol](thoughts/Protocol.md) Stack (from most abstract to least)\nEach layer takes data from above adds header information to create new data unit passes new data unit to layer below\n\n1. [Application Layer](thoughts/Application%20Layer.md) ([HTTP](thoughts/HTTP.md))\n2. [Transport Layer](thoughts/Transport%20Layer.md) ([TCP](thoughts/TCP.md), [UDP](thoughts/UDP.md))\n3. [Network Layer](thoughts/Network%20Layer.md) ([IP Addresses](thoughts/IP%20Addresses.md)) -- this is the 'thinnest' part of the network stack!\n4. [Link Layer](thoughts/Link%20Layer.md)\n5. [Physical Layer](thoughts/Physical%20Layer.md)\n\n\n## Hubs, Switches, and Routers\n1. Hub - broadcasting through cloning bits ([physical layer](thoughts/Physical%20Layer.md))\n\t1. Simplest and cheapest way to create a network\n\t2. Lots of unnecessary traffic\n\t3. Other people can see your traffic\n2. Switch - hub but it knows where other hosts are for direct addressing ([link layer](thoughts/Link%20Layer.md))\n\t1. Keeps a switch table mapping interface number to MAC address\n\t2. If table is initially empty, will behave like a hub and broadcast\n\t3. Can start populating switch table based off of sender field from frames\n\t4. Quicker than a router for internal communication (though some routers have an Ethernet switch built in)\n\t5. If engineered right, can be full-duplex\n3. Router - glue that ties networks together ([network layer](thoughts/Network%20Layer.md))\n\t1. Does NOT support broadcast\n\t2. Serves as a bridge between private home network and the network of the internet provider (which can reach the rest of the internet)\n\t3. Modern routers can also perform\n\t\t1. Network address translation ([NAT](thoughts/NAT.md))\n\t\t2. Assigning [IP addresses](thoughts/IP%20Addresses.md) to hosts using [DHCP](thoughts/DHCP.md)\n\t\t3. Broadcast WiFi signal\n\n## Error Correction\nMethods for [fault tolerance](thoughts/fault%20tolerance.md) in data transmission\n1. Parity Bit\n\t1. Even parity is 1 if number of 1s is odd\n\t2. Can detect odd number of bit flips\n3. 2D Parity Bit\n\t1. Additional parity bits for each row\n\t2. Additional parity bits for each column\n\t4. One last additional bit in last row of parity bits\n5. Checksum\n\t1. Assume data is a sequence of 16-bit integers\n\t2. Addition, 1's complement sum, carry out added back in\n\t3. Checksum is the 1's complement of the computed value\n\t4. Compare with the received data (if same, it is ok)\n\t\t1. Alternatively, compute the same function over the data and checksum\n6. Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)\n\t1. Uses only XOR and shift\n\t2. Parameterized by constants G and r\n\t3. r + 1 is the length of G (some power of 2)\n\t4. G is the generator (arbitrary bit pattern)\n\t5. Sender wants to send D\n\t\t1. Chooses r CRC bits, R such that \u003cD, R\u003e is exactly divisible by G (mod 2)\n\t6. Receiver knows G, divides \u003cD, R\u003e by G. If the remainder is non-zero an error is detected!\n\t7. Can detect all burst errors less than $r+1$ bits, and burst errors greater than $r+1$ with probability $1-0.5^r$\n\n## Access Control\n1. Half-duplex - both sides can transmit, but only one at a time\n\t1. Carrier Sense Multiple Access\n\t\t1. Listen before sending, only send if no one else is\n\t2. Collision Detection\n\t\t1. While sending, listen to see if what you are sending is garbled\n\t\t2. If so, give up\n\t3. \"Try again later\" uses binary exponential backoff\n\t\t1. Random backoff between 0 and power of 2 (n increases each time)\n\t4. Turn-based access control\n\t\t1. Controlled by centralized party - polls everyone\n\t\t2. Controlled in a decentralized manner - passes a token between senders\n2. Full-duplex - both sides can transmit at the same time without interference/[NAT](thoughts/NAT.md)\n\n## Network Metrics / Peformance\n- Bandwidth: max rate at which data can be sent over a link, usually in bits per second\n\t- Measured in base 10, kilobit is $10^3$ bits, megabit is $10^6$ bits\n- Sizes: usually in bytes\n\t- Measured in base 2, kilobyte is $2^{10}$ bytes, megabyte is $2^{20}$ bytes\n\t- Except for disk managers, who use bits to make sizes look larger\n- Latency: how long is it from when something is sent to when it is received\n\t- Packet and bit/byte latency: measure start of sending packet/bit/byte to receiving it\n\t- Round trip time: time to send packet and receiving a response\n- Jitter: variation in latency -- interpacket variance\n- Throughput: amount of data moved from one place to another in a given time\n\t- Usually measured in bytes not bits\n\t- \n- Goodput: rate at which *useful* data arrives\n\t- Does not include headers, encoding costs, etc.\n\nDelay\n- Average Service Time: time taken to put the average packet on the wire\n\t- $S = \\textrm{Average packet size} \\times \\frac{8 bits/byte}{\\textrm{Bandwidth}}$\n- Processing Delay: figuring out where packet should go\n\t- Pretty much fixed (almost always variable due to cache hits, network queues, etc. but because of how negligible the times are, we can treat as fixed.)\n- Queueing Delay: waiting time to get access to a link\n\t- Variable\n\t- Increase over service time when idle\n\t- $\\textrm{Delay}_{\\textrm{Queueing}} = \\frac{S}{1-U} - S$ where $S$ is the average service time when no other requests and $U$ is the server utilization (usually traffic intensity)\n- Transmission Delay: time to write packet to medium\n\t- Fixed for bits, variable for packets (dependent on size)\n\t- $\\textrm{Delay}_{\\textrm{Transmission}} = \\frac{\\textrm{Message size} \\times 8 bits/byte}{\\textrm{Bandwidth}}$ for *each* segment (as each router needs to receive the entire packet before adding it to the queue)\n- Propagation Delay: time to move each bit over transmission medium\n\t- Fixed for meter, variable depending on actual length traveled\n\t- $\\textrm{Delay}_{\\textrm{Propagation}} = \\frac{\\textrm{Total distance}}{\\textrm{Link speed}}$\n- End-to-end Delay: sum of all sources of delay\n\nTraffic Intensity\n- Determined by\n\t- Number of packets arriving per second: $a$\n\t- Average packet size: $L$ in bits\n\t- Transmission rate: rate at which bits are disposed of per second: $R$\n- Traffic Intensity: $\\frac{La}{R}$\n\n## Sliding Window\n- When we allow multiple packets in flight, modelling this with a finite state machine is less than ideal\n- We can use a sliding window to represent the 'window' of all bits that are in flight\n\t- Although, better version of this is to just use a proper protocol like [TCP](thoughts/TCP.md)\n- Timeout: how much longer should I wait for the ack for the first packet in my window\n\n- Big window costs us memory\n- Smaller window is easier to reason about\n\n### Go-back-N\n### Receiver\n- When packet is received, send ACK for last packet received in order\n- Discard arriving packet if out of order (receiver window is 1)\n### Sender\n- Can have a specific number of outstanding (unacknowledged) packets in memory: sender's window\n- Start timer on first packet sent\n- On timeout go to last unack'ed packet and resend everything (restart timer)\n- Received ACKs may be cumulative (restart timer on receipt)\n\n[Simulation Link](https://media.pearsoncmg.com/aw/ecs_kurose_compnetwork_7/cw/content/interactiveanimations/go-back-n-protocol/index.html)\n\n### Selective-Repeat Strategy\n### Receiver\n- Each packet is ack'ed individually\n- Out of order packet is stored for later: receiver's window\n- If a packet arrives whose sequence number is too small to fit in the window it will be ACKed and dropped.\n- Only when a packet whose sequence number is too large to fit in the window will it not be ACKed; such packets will be silently dropped.\n### Sender\n- Can have a specific number of outstanding (unacknowledged) packets in memory: sender's window\n- Each packet has its own timer and is individually resent if timeout is reached\n- ACKs received in order move the sender's window\n\n\n[Simulation Link](https://media.pearsoncmg.com/aw/ecs_kurose_compnetwork_7/cw/content/interactiveanimations/selective-repeat-protocol/index.html)\n\nCongestion/Flow Control\n- As long as sender's window size is smaller than the receivers window size, it's fine\n- If the network can't handle a full window's worth of data (packets + ACKs are dropped by routers) then sender can reduce sending window\n- If all packets are ACKed, we can increase the window again (too slow! we can up the pace)\n- Receiver will notify the sender about how much data it can handle (usually included in the ACK)\n- If receiver runs out of space, sender will send a packet every once in a while even though its not supposed to just to check if it now has space\n\n",

    "content": "\n\u003e Portability implies switching platforms, but true interoperability is platform-agnostic.\n\nI think interopability in the context of the web means being able to transparently understand and share data, agnostic of platform. Closed platforms disallow this as they curate the information they present to end-users/devs rather than letting users control their own data.\n\nA good standard is if I can hit 'export all data' on a platform and I can completely and freely use that elsewhere -- no vendor lock-in. I think this is esp hard for [social graphs](thoughts/social%20graphs.md), there is no common/accepted standard for identity let alone connectedness between individuals\n\nRelated: [tools for thought](thoughts/tools%20for%20thought.md)\n\n## Noun-based Interoperability\nSource: [Riffle: Building data-centric apps with a reactive relational database](https://riffle.systems/essays/prelude/)\n\n\u003e Since the introduction of object-oriented programming, most interoperability has been “verb-based”: that is, based on having programs call into each other using APIs. Indeed, new programmers are often taught to hide data behind APIs as much as possible in order to encapsulate state. Unfortunately, [verb-based APIs create an unfortunate n-to-n problem](https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1452438198668328960): every app needs to know how to call the APIs of every other app. In contrast, data-based interoperability can use the shared data directly: once an app knows how to read a data format, it can read that data regardless of which app produced it.\n\nHow do we create sources of truth that are *legible outside of the application*, possibly in ways that the application developer never anticipated?\n\n(see: data lensing in [idea list](thoughts/idea%20list.md))\n\n## Beyond Windows\n[Source: Universal data portability by *Alexander Obenauer*](https://alexanderobenauer.com/labnotes/002/)\n\nA modern day [HyperCard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard). What other types of [interaction design](thoughts/interaction%20design.md) can we facilitate?\n\n\u003e A window runs a self-contained program, isolated from other programs that […] run at the same time in other windows.

What if applications exposed data by default?\n\nAn application then is a specific *view* on types of data rather than a standalone thing. Data can be dragged through different applications. Each data is annotated with a type. There is also a most common interface for data that allows basic-level interop with any application. We can then create an open marketplace for views on data.\n\nApps in this operating system then declare 'default' apps for certain data types.\n\nAbility to not only source local data but remote data too -\u003e fetching from URLs, feeds, etc. \n\nUNIX-level composability -- apps should be atomic building blocks.

Auto generate a day-summary for the next day. etc.\n\n### Chronological Data Querying\nWhat data was created a few days ago? etc.\n\n## Adverserial Interoperability\n[Source: Adversarial Interoperability by *Cory Doctorow*](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability)\n\n\u003e When you create a new product or service that plugs into the existing ones _without the permission_ of the companies that make them. Think of third-party printer ink, alternative app stores, or independent repair shops that use compatible parts from rival manufacturers to fix your car or your phone or your tractor.\n\n## Data Lenses\nSource: [Ink and Switch on Cambria](https://www.inkandswitch.com/cambria/)\n\nAn organization must balance their desire to change their API against their customers' reluctance to change something that works for them. The result is strong pressure to preserve backward compatibility over time, often across many versions.\n\nDevelopers rely on tribal knowledge to inform them which operations are safe—for example, they intuit that they can respond with additional data, trusting existing clients to ignore it, but not require additional data in requests, because existing clients won’t know to send it. Developers also often resort to shotgun parsing: scattering data checks and fallback values in various places throughout the system’s main logic. This can often lead not just to bugs, but also security vulnerabilities.\n\nHowever, in practice, most interoperability requires a tradeoff between\n- Consistency: both sides see a meaningfully equivalent view of the world\n- Conservation: neither side operates on data they can’t observe\n- Predictability: the local intent of every operation is preserved\n\n### Cambria\nOver time, a project using Cambria will accumulate many lenses, each describing the relationship between two versions. Migrations between distant versions are created by composing lenses into a graph where each node is a schema, and each edge is a lens. To translate data between two schemas, Cambria sends it through the shortest available path in the lens graph. These lenses must be kept in a place where even old versions of the program can retrieve them, such as in a database, at a well-known URL, or else as part of the document itself.\n\n![](https://www.inkandswitch.com/cambria/static/lens-graph.svg)\nCaveats:\n- Imagine a lens that combines a firstName and lastName fields into a single fullName. This lens works reliably in one direction. All names already stored in the system could be combined into a single field, but there are many names which could not be reliably converted back to “first” and “last” names. The result is a so-called lens that can only run reliably in one direction.",

    "content": "\n- What is data? Anything that is useful for understanding a particular design, user needs, and user behaviour.\n- What does it mean to collect user data? What techniques can be used, and how useful and reliable is the data that is collected?\n\nFive Key Issues\n1. Settings Goals. Goals will influence the nature of data gathering sessions, the data gathering techniques to be used, and the analysis to be performed.\n2. Identifying Participants. Those who fit the profile of types of people from whom data can be gathered are called the study population. Types of sampling are as follows:\n  - Probability Sampling: simple random sampling or stratified sampling\n  - Nonprobability Sampling: convenience sampling or volunteer panels\n    - Convenience Sampling: sample includes those who were available rather than those specifically selected\n3. Relationship with Participants: informed consent with a clear and professional relationship between participant and researcher (however, informed consent is generally not required when gathering requirements data for commercial company where a contract usually exist between collector and provider)\n\nTriangulation: the investigation of a phenomenon from at least two different perspectives. This is mostly focused on verification and reliability of data rather than making up for the limitations of another type of methodology\n1. Triangulation of data: data is drawn from different sources at different times/places/people\n2. Investigator triangulation: different researchers (observers, interviewers, and so on) have been involved in collecting and interpreting the data\n3. Triangulation of theories: use of different theoretical frameworks through which to view data\n4. Methodological triangulation: employ different data gathering techniques\n\n## 3 Methods for Data Recording\n1. Notes + Photographs -\u003e least technical and most flexible way of recording data, but can be difficult to capture the right highlights.\n2. Audio + Photographs -\u003e less intrusive than video, allows observers to focus on the activity rather than on trying to capture every spoken word.\n3. Video -\u003e highest fidelity. Things to keep in mind: 1) whether to fix cam position or use a roving recorder 2) where to point the camera 3) understanding the imapct of the recording on the participants\n\n## Interviews\n\u003e A conversation with a purpose\n\nGood for exploring issues, learning more about tasks, and getting inside user's head.\n\nCriteria for good interview:\n    -   Before:\n        -   get questions right → should support goals, should be easy to understand/answer\n        -   be organized → check equipment, have necessary docs\n        -   run pilots\n    -   During:\n        -   structure time\n        -   give participants context\n        -   use props and visuals → easier to show than tell\n    -   Listen well throughout!\n\n1. Open-ended/unstructured -\u003e exploratory and similar to conversation. Can be time-consuming but can also produce rich insights\n2. Semi-structured -\u003e plans basic script with both closed and open questions but probes interviewee until no new relevants info is there\n3. Structured -\u003e predetermined questions like a questionnaire, study is standardized (same questions with each participant)\n4. Group interviews -\u003e 3-10 people selected to provide a representative sample of the target population. Useful for investigating shared issues rather than individual experiences\n\nAsking questions like \"Can you tell me a bit more about...\" is called probing\n\n### Planning\nWhen developing Interview Questions, keep in mind open questions are best suited where the goal of the session is exploratory; closed questions are best suited where the possible answers are known in advance. Break long or compound questions into separate questions\n\nA lot of decisions to make:\n- Choosing a framework\n- Level of participation to adopt\n- How to make a record of the data\n- How to gain acceptance into the group being studied\n- How to ensure that the study uses difference perspectives\n\nEthnography: the description of the customs of people and cultures. A distinguishing feature of ethnographic studies compared with other data gathering is that a situation is observed without imposing any a priori structure or framework upon it, and everything is viewed as \"strange\".\n\n| Technique | Good for | Kind of Data | Advantages | Disadvantages |\n| --------- | -------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------------- |\n| Interviews | Exploring issues | Mostly qualitative (some quantitative) | Interviewer can guide, encourages contact between researchers and users | Artificial environment might be intimidating, remove them from usual environment |\n| Focus Groups | Collecting multiple viewpoints | Mostly qualitative (some quantitative) | Highlight areas of agreement/conflict, encourages contact between researchers and users | Possibility of dominant characters |\n| Questionnaires | Answering specific questions | Quantitative and Qualitative | Can reach many people with low resource requirements | Design is key, response rates may be low |\n| Direct observation in the field | Understanding context of user activity | Mostly qualitative | Observational insights | Very time-consuming, huge amounts of data |\n| Direct observation in a controlled environment | Captural detail of individuals | Quantitative and qualitative | User can focus on task without interruption | Data may be of limited use due to artificial environment |\n| Indirect observation | Observing users in natural environment without distraction | Quantitative (logging) and qualitative (diary) | Can be long due to automative recording | Large amounts of data implies need for tools to support analysis, participants may exaggerate memories |\n\n### Running the interview\nBefore starting, make sure that the goals of the interview have been explained to the interviewee and that they are willing to proceed. Listen more than talk, repond with sympathy but without bias, and to appear to enjoy the interview.\n\n1.  **Intro**\n    -   interviewer introduces themselves\n    -   explain why you're doing the interview\n    -   reassure interviewee re: ethical issues\n    -   ask interviewee if they mind being recorded\n2.  **Warm-up session**\n    -   easy, nonthreatening questions\n3.  **Main session**\n    -   questions presented in logical sequence\n    -   probing questions at the end\n    -   order may vary in semi-structured interview\n4.  **Cooling-off period**\n    -   easy questions to defuse any tension\n5.  **Closing session**\n    -   interviewer thanks interviewee\n    -   switch off recorder or put notebook away\n\n## Observation\nUsers may be observed directly by the investigator as they perform their activities or indirectly through records of the activity that are studied afterward.\n\nObservation can also result in a lot of data to sift through and can be complicated to do well than at firs appreciated. As such, a clearly stated goal is important to have focus for an observation session.\n\nExample frameworks:\n- The person: Who is using the technology at any particular time?\n- The place: Where are they using it?\n- The thing: What are they doing with it?\n\n3 common approaches\n1. Simple observation: user is given a task, the evaluator just watches. This gives no insight into users' decision process\n2. Think aloud: subjects asked to say what they are thinking/doing. However, its hard to talk while concentrating and thinking may alter the way people naturally perform the task.\n3. Co-discovery learning: two people work together on a task and normal conversation is monitored.\n\n### Degree of Participation\n1. Passive Observer: observer who adopts an approach at the outsider end; does not take part in the study environment at all\n2. Participant Observer: adopts an approach at the insider end; becomes a member of the group being studied\n\n### Coding Sheet\n\u003e A data recording instrument in which a list of itemized coding options are structured\n\nThis standardizes observation practices which makes it more objective.\n\nConsider:\n-   evaluation goals (break it all down!)\n-   stage of design\n-   observation method/types of data\n\t-   what would potentially be an interesting finding from this particular style?\n\t-   e.g. for think-aloud, it might be good to record action vs spoken comments\n\n## Questionnaire\nSurvey vs Questionnaire: the questionnaire is a *part* of the survey. The questionnaire is just the concrete things you're asking.\n\nPros\n-   cheap\n-   does not require presence of evaluator\n-   many results can be quantified\n\nCons\n-   preparation is \"expensive\" → need to design questions well\n-   can have low response rate or low quality response\n-   difficult to do in-depth \"probing\"\n\nA questionnaire is good when motivation is high enough without anyone else present. If persuasion is needed, a structured interview is probably better\n\n### Designing a Questionnaire\nKeep in mind\n- what info is sought?\n- how would you analyze results?\n- what audience do you want to reach?\n- what will you do with your analysis?\n\nDon't use vague questions, pilot the questionnaire before testing.\n\nQuestions\n- should not be transferable to other interfaces, can't be interpreted in different ways depending on judgment (i.e. domain specific and clear wording)\n-  avoid double-barreled questions and leading questions\n-  to de-bias: neutral language, can have random order of questions for different participants\n-  for validity\n\t-  use previously validated questionnaires\n\t-  triangulation (ask multiple questions about the same matter)\n\t-  piloting\n\n#### Types of questions**\n- Open-ended (hard to analyze rigorously)\n- Closed (easily analyzed but can be hard to interpret if not well-designed)\n\t-  checkboxes and ranges\n\t\t-   range of answers to demo questions is predictable: offer a predefined list\n\t\t-   interval doesn't have to be equal in all cases, depends on what you want to know\n\t\t-   mention how many boxes to check, be consistent with ascending/descending order\n\t-   Likert and semantic differential scale\n\t\t-   used for measuring opinions, attitudes, and beliefs\n\t\t-   widely used for evaluating user satisfaction\n\t\t-   Likert: a five, seven, or nine-point agreement scale used to measure respondents' agreement with various statements\n\t\t-   semantic differential scale: rely on choosing pairs of adjectives to explore a range of bipolar attitudes about particular opinions\n\t-   ranked (closed)\n\t\t-   respondent places ordering on items in a list\n\t\t-   useful to indicate preferences\n\t\t-   forced choice\n\t-   multi-choice (closed)\n\t\t-   offered choice of explicit responses\n\nChecklist\n-   think about ordering of questions → impact can be influenced by order\n-   consider if different versions are needed for different populations\n-   provide clear instructions on how to complete questionnaire\n    -   eg. if answers can be saved and completed later\n-   think about length → avoid questions that don't address study goals\n-   consider allowing respondents to opt out at different stages especially if long → better to have some than none\n-   think about layout and pacing\n\n## Data and Analysis\n- Subjective: what you were told what happened\n- Objective: what you captured using your senses\n- Quantitative: data in the form of numbers or data that can be easily translated into numbers. Focuses on ascertain magnitude, amount, or size of something\n- Qualitative: data in the form of words and images. Focuses on nature of something (themes, patterns, and stories)\n\nNote that quantitative data is not always objective! Subjectivity can come from participants in how they express opinions or from investigators during the data capturing/interpreting/analysis process.\n\nSimilarly, it is unfair to try to [quantize](thoughts/quantization.md) all qualitative data. This needs justification. Also be wary of translating small populatino sizes into percentages.\n\n### What to focus on\n1. What are the most important needs/tasks to support?\n2. What are the repeated patterns?\n3. Key issues/areas that could be improved\n4. What surprised you?\n5. What is essential/nonessential in implementation\n\n### Steps\n1. Initial reactions or observations (identify patterns, simple numerical analysis like averages, ratios, percentages)\n2. Data cleansing (checking for erroneous entries and anomalies)\n3. Analysis\n\n### Qualitative Analysis\n#### Thematic Analysis\nThemes are a small number of high-level patterns that answer your evaluation questions.\n\nGoing from codes (descriptive labels) to categories (grouping imposed on codes) to themes (interpretive patterns). Deductive analysis is just the inverse (starting at themes and arriving at codes)\n\nDo an initial pass to check of internal consistency: make sure themes occur across several or all participants. Then, step back to see if an overarching narrative emerges from the themes. One can them remove themes or look into why there are conflicts.\n\nOne way of doing this is using affinity diagrams:\n1.  record each idea/observation/problem/etc on individual card or post-it notes\n2.  look for notes that seem to be related\n3.  sort notes into groups until all used\n    -   sort and resort as necessary\n\n#### Categorizing Data\n-   scheme of data: code the data according to categories\n\t-   if analysis frame is chosen beforehand: deductive analysis\n\t-   if study is explanatory and it is important to let themes emerge from data: inductive analysis\n-   can then analyze with appropriate methods like counting averages # of problems or identifying recurring patterns\n\n### Critical Incident Analysis\nHelps identify significant subsets of data for more detailed analysis.\n\nThis is not about summarizing all incidients, more like finding gold nuggets. Incidents need not be bad all the time, can be either desirable or undesirable.\n\n",

If a service shuts down, the software stops functioning, and data created with that software is lost.\n\n## Ink and Switch\n[You own your data, in spite of the cloud](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/)\n\nTo sum up: the cloud gives us collaboration, but old-fashioned apps give us ownership. Can’t we have the best of both worlds?\n\n- Traditional web app model: \"If it's not stored in the server database, it didn't really happen\"\n- Local-first model: \"The client's local storage is what matters -- the server is just for multi-user sync and backup\"\n\nLocal-first ideals include\n1. No spinners: your work at your fingertips\n\t- All operations can be handled by reading and writing files on the local disk, and data synchronization with other devices happens quietly in the background.\n2. Your work is not trapped on one device\n3. Network is optional\n4. Seamless collaboration\n\t1. Auto-merging changes using a [[thoughts/CRDT|CRDT]] or OT\n\t2. Asynchronous changes that need review (e.g. suggestions or pull requests)\n5. The long now (optional permanence/digital longetivity)\n\t- When you do some work with local-first software, your work should continue to be accessible indefinitely, even after the company that produced the software is gone.\n6. Security and privacy by default\n\t- Many professionals cannot use cloud apps due to regulatory compliance and confidentiality obligations.\n7. User retains ownership and control\n\t- You should be able to copy and modify data in any way, write down any thought, and no company should restrict what you are allowed to do.\n\nA potential digital dark age is looming. The documents created in cloud apps are destined to disappear when the creators of those services cease to maintain them. Cloud services defy long-term preservation. No Wayback Machine can restore a sunsetted web application. The Internet Archive cannot preserve your Google Docs.\n\nServers have a role to play in the local-first world — not as central authorities, but as “cloud peers” that support client applications without being on the critical path. For example, a cloud peer that stores a copy of the document, and forwards it to other peers when they come online, could solve the closed-laptop problem.\n\nThe key difference between traditional systems and local-first systems is not an absence of servers, but a change in their responsibilities: they are in a supporting role, not the source of truth.\n\nActive questions:\n1. CRDTs accumulate a large change history, which creates performance problems. These pile up, but can’t easily be truncated because it’s impossible to know when someone might reconnect to your shared document after six months away and need to merge changes from that point forward.\n2. Network communication remains an unsolved problem. The use of P2P technologies in our prototypes yielded mixed results. On one hand, these technologies are nowhere near production-ready: NAT traversal, in particular, is unreliable depending on the particular router or network topology where the user is currently connected.\n3. Visualizing document history is important and difficult. How do we communicate this version history to users? How should users think about versioning, share and accept changes, and understand how their documents came to be a certain way when there is no central source of truth?",

Related to [paid open source](posts/paid-open-source.md), how do we incentivize maintenance?\n\nIs maintenance just the battle against the [tragedy of the commons](thoughts/tragedy%20of%20the%20commons.md)? \"Fundamentally, digital infrastructure has a free rider problem. Resources are offered for free, and everybody (whether individual developer or large software company) uses them, so nobody is incentivized to contribute back, figuring that somebody else will step in.\" [Source](https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/23/open-source-sustainability)\n\nWho are all the maintainers behind the thousands of libraries we depend on each day? Is maintenance a form of Ghost Work?\n\nCan we use [web3](thoughts/web3.md) to 'codify' maintenance as a value? Is maintenance inherently centralized (i.e. we need a centralized body to uphold a [public good](thoughts/public%20goods.md))\n\n## [Innovation](thoughts/innovation.md) is overvalued\n[Source: Hail the maintainers by *Andrew Russell and *](https://aeon.co/essays/innovation-is-overvalued-maintenance-often-matters-more)\n\n[The Maintainers Organization](https://themaintainers.org/) and their [fellowship](https://themaintainers.org/summer-fellow)\n\n\"What happens _after_ innovation, they argue, is more important. Maintenance and repair, the building of infrastructures, the mundane labour that goes into sustaining functioning and efficient infrastructures, simply has more impact on people’s daily lives than the vast majority of technological innovations.\"\n\n\"These shuttles brought high-tech employees from hip, pricey urban homes to their lush suburban campuses, without exposing them to the inconvenience of public transportation or to the vast populations of the poor and homeless who also call Silicon Valley their home.\" -\u003e similar to some concepts in [From Counterculture to Cyberculture](thoughts/From%20Counterculture%20to%20Cyberculture.md) talking about displacement of people during the 'back to the land'  movement by the New Communalists\n\n**It is crucial to understand that technology is not innovation.** This preoccupation with novelty is unfortunate because it fails to account for technologies in widespread use, and it obscures how many of the things around us are quite old.\n\nThe stalest innovation stories focus on well-to-do white guys sitting in garages in a small region of California, but human beings in the Global South live with technologies too. Which ones? Where do they come from? How are they produced, used, repaired?\n\nRelated: [Lindy Effect](thoughts/Lindy%20effect.md), [broken world thinking](thoughts/broken%20world%20thinking.md)\n\nThird, focusing on [infrastructure](thoughts/infrastructure.md) or on old, existing things rather than novel ones reminds us of the absolute centrality of the work that goes into keeping the entire world going. We need to acknowledge and attribute where we are today to the shoulders of the giants we stand on.\n\n\"Feminist theorists have long argued that obsessions with technological novelty obscures all of the labour, including housework, that women, disproportionately, do to keep life on track.\"\n\n## Maintenance and Care\n[Shannon Mattern in Places Journal](https://placesjournal.org/article/maintenance-and-care)\n\n\u003e “All of the incentives for all the actors are against maintenance. Nobody ever named a maintenance project, nobody ever got recognized for a maintenance project, nobody ever much got blamed for deferring maintenance during the time while they were in office.”\n\n### Rust: urban infrastructures\n\nOutsiders sometimes make the mistake of focusing on the rusty bridges and broken pipes — the “defective objects” themselves — whereas local fixers are more concerned with “the social and political relationships in which [those objects are] embedded.”\n\nAs Nikhil Anand writes in _Hydraulic City_, \"The maintenance of water infrastructures binds residents, plumbers, engineers, and politicians in an (uneven) system of “hydraulic citizenship.”\"\n\nWe should always ask: what, exactly, is being maintained? “Is it the thing itself,” Graham and Thrift ask, “or the negotiated order that surrounds it, or some ‘larger’ entity?” Often the answer is all of the above. \n\nWe should also remember that the preservation of our world — the human one — is sometimes at odds with caring for the ecological context. Perhaps not every road _should_ be repaired. Geographer Caitlin DeSilvey encourages us to embrace entropy within the built world, to ask ourselves _for whom_ we engage in preservation, and to consider cultivating an acceptance of “curated decay” where appropriate.\n\n### Dust: domestic maintenance, housework, care work\n\nMaintaining life — that’s a big job. Joan Tronto and Berenice Fisher define care as “everything that we do to maintain, continue, and repair ‘our world’ so that we can live in it as well as possible.\n\n**We care for things not because they produce value, but because they already have value.**\n\nAryn Martin, Natasha Myers, and Ana Viseu propose that a critical practice of care would “pay attention to the privileged position of the caring subject, wary of who has the power to care, and who or what tends to get designated the proper or improper objects of care.”\n\n### Cracks: repair of objects\n\n“repair not only extends the use value of objects but becomes a mechanism of social interaction.” People gather around, watch, and chat. The shop is a space of public pedagogy, an “operating theater” where the repairman opens gadgets, demonstrates technical skills, and perhaps encourages observers to mend rather than discard their own broken things\n\n### Corruption: curators who clean and maintain data\n\nHistorian Nathan Ensmenger reports that “from the early 1960s to the present, software maintenance costs have represented between 50 and 70 percent of all total expenditures on software development.”\n\nThe internal maintenance work isn’t supposed to be visible to end users, who tend to like the idea that they’re working with “raw” data. Yet “data never come as raw,” Plantin observes. “Multiple interventions are always needed before data can be reused.”",

A core perspective or mission. That could be advocating for a certain perspective, aesthetic, region, idea, or about solving a problem and changing the world.\n2.  A principle (or group of principles) curating the output. Labels are ultimately trying to communicate an idea, incrementally, with each release. That means they need a consistent vision to successfully put an idea in the mind of the public. This means a level of creative leadership is required to curate what releases and artists are invited to be a part of the project.\n3.  Discrete releases. A label exists to put culture into the world, whether that’s music, ideas, a way of living, words, or something else. What makes a label unique from a person’s personal creative practice is that different people are invited to release work under the same banner. By constructing an umbrella under which multiple artists can sit, the label can generate more dialogue and “heat” because disparate nodes in the network are reflecting back similar ideals. What makes a label unique from a brand is that all of a brand’s efforts result in the promotion of a single product. In the case of a label, its efforts are always promoting different products that all relate to the same core aesthetics or ideals. \n4.  Information architecture. Record labels use catalogue numbers to sequence their releases. A similar sequencing or contextualizing of works is a key element of the label. It helps clue t he audience into the larger context of the work. This is already common in the new worlds of drop commerce and Web3, where concepts like “Seasons” have become used to conceptually organize content and community, bringing the language of fashion and television into broader cultural creation. This mixing is a hallmark of meta labeling.\n5.  A scene it participates in. Labels are at their best when they represent or are in dialogue with a thriving, organic scene or community. To truly be valuable, it must create value for the larger scene it’s a member of.\n6. A source of funding. Without funds to put into projects, any label is limited in its output. Previous labels used sales from their products to fund new releases, or someone’s existing personal wealth. In the world of Web3 and meta labels, these sources of funding are evolving",

This engineering is safe: most authors exert their influence slowly, over hundreds of pages, and if the effect turns out to be undesirable, you need only put the book down. It’s cheap and reliable — if you want to emulate someone, start by reading what they read.

    "content": "\n\u003e Money is a form of shared truth\n\nSources: [Money Language *in Kernel*](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-0/money-language) and [Shelling Out *in Kernel*](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-2/shelling-out)\n\nMoney is old. \"We have yet to discover a civilization that didn't have money. So, we know it's at least as old as civilization.\"\n\nMoney is a language through which to communicate value. Then, was does this mean for [decentralization](thoughts/decentralization.md)? No one should control the expression of economic value in exactly the same way that no one controls the meaning of words: they are arrived at consensually through common use.\n\nWhat money is, how it is created, and who gets to distribute it goes to the very heart of the ways in which we are all incentivised to act\n\n[Incentives](thoughts/incentives.md) can be thought of as the [social, political and neurobiological primitives](thoughts/social%20contracts.md) which define what kinds of behaviours we express.\n\n\u003e Programmable money provides utility which makes it much more than just money for the internet: **it turns it into the [internet](thoughts/Internet.md) of money**.\n\nMoney allows specialization, allowing goods and services to be transformed into a intermediary representation that is accepted by society.\n\n## Master-slave vs [Peer-to-peer](thoughts/peer-to-peer.md)\nDifference between hierarchical and [decentralized](thoughts/decentralization.md) methods.\n\nQuestion is \"who is the slave\"? Supposedly the those that need to follow the interfaces that the master dictates, there is no 'ownership'.\n\nWhat does this mean in the context of efficiency in systems? [Consensus](thoughts/consensus.md) takes a long time. Decentralized methods are hard to get right. Is the tradeoff worth it? At what point do we trade good user experience with rights of data ownership?\n\n## Money and Speech\n\n\u003e Free as in beer or free as in speech? -- Richard Stallman\n\nFreedom of speech means that our *ability to speak* is free, but that doesn't mean we can say whatever we want (e.g. hate speech and defamation).\n\nSimilarly for [web3](thoughts/web3.md), access to the network is unrestricted (you only need a connection), but saying anything meaningful (e.g. state changing on the shared public record) has an associated cost. Thus certain behaviours we agree to be malicious (like creating fake transactions) are not disallowed, but just economically unsustainable.\n\nWouldn't this favour the rich? Well yes, but we can mitigate this by using weighting like [quadratic voting/funding](thoughts/quadratic%20funding.md) which values number of unique contributions more than dollar amounts.\n\n### Taxes\nLaffer curve: as the tax rate increases, the rate at which revenue increases slows down due to increased avoidance, evasion, and disincentive to engage in the taxed activity.\n\nThis can be applied to the rise and fall of empires: \"governments that overburdened their taxpayers, such as the Soviet Union and later Roman Empire, ended up on the dust-heap of history, while governments that collected below the optimum were often conquered by their better-funded neighbors.\"\n\n(Although, might not be [100% valid](https://qz.com/895785/laffer-curve-everything-trump-and-republicans-get-wrong-about-trickle-down-economics-and-reaganomics/amp/))\n\n### Dispute Resolution\n\u003e Most pre-modern cultures, ranging from the Iriquois in America to the pre-Christian Germanic peoples, decided that payment was better than punishment\n\nCurious if the main reason is that you need to keep track of whether someone has served their punishment or not and memory historically has been unreliable. On the contrary, you don't need to remember whether you were paid because you can just count your money.\n\nThe question applied to [web3](thoughts/web3.md): **can we advance the aims of rehabilitative justice using a shared and common historical record for better [accountability](thoughts/accountability.md)?**\n\n## Engineering Money\n\u003e Money-as-a-[protocol](thoughts/Protocol.md) really allows us to do is program incentives at scales never before possible\n\nMoney, in this context, is not a concrete thing, its an abstraction to communicative values, as a language, and as a technology. It is a classifier for things that exhibit behaviour that lets us use it for\n1. Store of Value\n2. Medium of Exchange\n3. Unit of Account\n\nMore importantly, there are tradeoffs in the above properties.\nGold is a great store of value but sucks as a medium of exchange (interesting tangent, the traditional heuristic that money *should* have inherent intrinsic value which is separate from the money but the truth is almost the opposite. If the medium used to express transactional relationship has its own value, its not a very functional abstraction).\n\nHistorically, like physical materials, we've just accepted properties the way they are and just built what we could with them. However, also like physical materials, we've found ways to engineer the fundamental properties that we want.\n\nHowever, it feels liek we run into a weird [catch 22](thoughts/catch%2022.md) here where it is debatable whether the new 'engineered money' actually does have the properties we claim to have so it holds us back from developing/accepting it any more. I think this is in large part due to money being a combination of both **technical protocols and [social contracts](thoughts/social%20contracts.md)**\n \nAndreas' argument is that we can use abstract monetary protocols which we can engineer to change gradually higher-order social contracts.",

It dictates what type of research and work gets [funded](thoughts/funding.md), and who gets to do it. \n\nIt's important to be aware of the incentive structures in place wherever you work (e.g. academia, industry): 80k hours of work in your life, it matters a lot where that goes (voting with labour). \n\nOne of the reasons we're not seeing another Xerox Parc/Bell Labs, it feels like there is too *much* [perception in globalized communities](thoughts/communities.md).

(is this due to [creation vs maintenance](thoughts/creation%20vs%20maintenance.md) approaches to thinking?)\n\nProcurement services: finding a business application of research (specifically government funded)\n\nWe're not building a utopia of research, this is more about finding a relationship/group of people you can be yourself with. It doesn't need to be permanent, recognizing people have different stages in their lives. Once youre done, you can move on.\n\nRelated: reinventing [hackathons](posts/hackathons.md) as 3rd spaces\n\n## PARPA and alternative [funding](thoughts/funding.md) models\nhttps://benjaminreinhardt.com/parpa / https://benjaminreinhardt.com/wddw / https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w24674/w24674.pdf\n\nFrom the [Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/we-need-new-science-progress/594946/): \"In a recent paper, Pierre Azoulay and co-authors [concluded](https://www.nber.org/papers/w15466) that Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s long-term grants to high-potential scientists made those scientists 96 percent more likely to produce breakthrough work. If this finding is borne out, it suggests that present funding mechanisms are likely to be far from optimal, in part because they do not focus enough on research autonomy and risk taking.\"\n\n## Orgs\n### New Science\nhttps://newscience.org/\n\n\u003e New Science will create a network of new scientific institutes pursuing basic research while not being dependent on universities, the NIH, and the rest of traditional academia and, importantly, not being dominated culturally by academia.\n\nTheir plan is to not replace traditional academic institutions, but to develop alternative/complementary ones to provide 'competitive pressures' on existing ones. New Science is to research as Silicon Valley was to entrepreneurship.\n\nIncentive and organizational structures are not everything.  You can copy all of the US’s laws and structures of government and this will absolutely not lead to your country’s GDP per capita suddenly (or ever) jumping to $60k/year. Similar things can be said about research organizations.\n\n\"Instead, I believe that the most promising way to achieve large-scale improvement in the way basic scientific research is organized is to start small, help individual scientists, and to make [small steps towards a much better world](https://marginalrevolution.com/).\" Is this potentially good justification for [minigrants](thoughts/idea%20list.md)?\n\n### Santa Fe\nhttps://www.santafe.edu/\n\nThemes of research generally surround complex systems and a more system-based approach to analyzing and learning about the world: https://www.santafe.edu/research/themes\n\n\u003e Computers were becoming more powerful, and some scientists began to dream of a day when they might simulate highly complex systems, even living systems, in silico.\n\n\"We weren’t disillusioned,\" [Pines, the SFI Co-founder] says. \"But we recognized that [universities](thoughts/academia.md) were ill-equipped to nurture emerging new fields, and we were thinking about how we could help them grow. If we could create an institution where they could flourish, we thought we could make a difference.\"\n\n\u003e All we needed was a few million dollars, a building, a staff, and a great deal of luck... The key was simply to create a refuge for brilliant scholars to interact in an environment that was free from boundaries – what one collaborator many years later called “a spa for the brain.”\n\n",

    "content": "\n## Template Matching\nLinear filtering is also known as template matching. Convolution/correlation can be thought of as comparing a template (the kernel) with each section of the image.\n- Consider the filter and image section as vectors\n- Applying the filter can be interpreted as computing the dot product between the filter and the local image patch\n\nThe correlation is then normalized to between -1 and 1 using cosine similarity, where 1 is the value when the filter and image region are identical. This process is essentially finding the cosine similarity between template and local image neighbourhood\n\n$$\\cos\\theta = \\frac{a \\cdot b}{|a||b|} = \\frac{a \\cdot b}{\\sqrt{(a \\cdot a)(b \\cdot b)}} = \\frac{a}{|a|} \\frac{b}{|b|}$$\n\nThen, we can map over the image and create a correlation map. Thresholding this gives us detections.\n\nGood:\n1. Robust against noise\n2. Relatively easy to compute\nBad:\n1. Scaling (we can address this using scaled representations like a Gaussian image pyramid)\n2. Rotation\n3. Lighting conditions\n4. Sensitive to viewing direction and pose (in 3D worlds)\n\n### Gaussian Image Pyramid\nCollection of representations of an image. Typically, each layer of the pyramid is half the width and half the height of the previous layer. In the Gaussian version, each layer is smoothed by a Gaussian then resampled to get the next layer.\n\nDetails get smoothed out (are completely lost) as we move to higher levels, only large uniform regions of colours in the original image are left.\n\n![Upsampling Process](https://miro.medium.com/max/1016/1*Q9UKqUC6OqpR3KL1yRrXxA.png)\n\n### Laplacian Pyramid\nTo do this, create a Gaussian pyramid and take the difference between one pyramid level and the next after smoothing but before subsampling. \n\nAt each level, retain the residuals (difference between smoothed image and normal image) instead of the blurred images themselves.\n\nConstructing the pyramid, we repeat until min resolution reached:\n1. Blur\n2. Compute Residual\n3. Subsample\n\nReconstructing, we repeat until original resolution reached:\n1. Upsample\n2. Blur\n3. Sum with residual\n\n## Local Feature Detection\n\u003e Moving from global template matching to local template matching (e.g.edges and corners)\n\nAs differentiation is linear and shift invariant, we can implement it as a convolution.\n\nThe discrete approximation is $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\approx \\frac{F(X+ \\Delta x, y) - F(x,y)}{\\Delta x}$ where $\\Delta x$ is usually $1$. This is equivalent to a convolution $F$ is a $1 \\times 2$ filter with the first element is $-1$ and the second element is $1$. Note that the derivatives go up for the Y direction and the right for the X direction.\n\nWe usually smooth the image prior to derivative estimation. Increased smoothing\n- eliminates noise edges\n- makes edges smoother and thicker\n- removes fine detail\n\nWeights of a filter for differentiation should sum to 0 as a constant image should have derivative 0.\n\n### Edge Detection\nThe goal here is to identify sudden changes in image brightness as this encodes the vast majority of shape information.\n\nAn edge is a location with high gradient.\n\nMainly caused by\n- Depth discontinuity\n- Surface orientation discontinuity\n- Reflectance discontinuity (e.g. change in material)\n- Illumination discontinuity (e.g. shadows)\n\nAs we usually smooth prior to derivative calculation and convolution is associative, we can combine both steps and use derivatives of Gaussian filters.\n\n$$D \\otimes (G \\otimes I(X,Y)) = (D \\otimes G) \\otimes I(X,Y)$$\n\n#### Sobel (Gradient Magnitude)\nLet $I(X,Y)$ be an image. Then, we let $I_x(X,Y)$ and $I_y(X,Y)$ be estimates of the partial derivatives in the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively. Then, the vector $[I_x, I_y]$ or $\\nabla f = [\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}]$ is the gradient and $\\sqrt{I_x^2+I_y^2}$ is the gradient magnitude.\n\nThe gradient points in the direction of most rapid increase of intensity. The direction is then $\\theta = \\arctan{\\frac{\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}}{\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}}}$. The strength of the edge is then the magnitude $||\\nabla f|| = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}^2 + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}^2}$.\n\n#### Marr/Hildreth (Laplacian of Gaussian)\n**Design Criteria**\n1. localization of space (find where the edge is)\n2. localization in frequency (identify high frequency and low frequency edges)\n3. rotationally invariant (rotation shouldn't affect edges)\n\nFind the zero-crossings (intercepts) of the Laplacian of the Gaussian. This is $\\nabla^2 G(x,y) = \\frac{-1}{2\\pi\\sigma^4}[2-\\frac{x^2+y^2}{\\sigma^2}]\\exp{(-\\frac{x^2+y^2}{2\\sigma^2})} = 0$\n\nAlternatively, we can say that subtracting the delta function from the Gaussian gives you an approximation of the Laplacian\n\n#### Canny (Local Extrema of 1st deriv)\n**Design Criteria**\n1. good detection (reduce missed edges, reduced edges where edges don't exist)\n2. good localization (accurate edge detection)\n3. one (single) response to a given edge\n\nFind the local extrema of a first derivative operator.\n\nSteps\n1. Apply directional derivatives of Gaussian\n2. Computer gradient magnitude and gradient direction\n3. Perform non-max suppression\n\tNon-max suppression allows us to suppress near-by similar detections to obtain one \"true\" result. In images, we select the maximum point across the width of the edge (following the direction of the gradient).\n \n\tIn implementations, the value at a pixel $q$ must be larger than its interpolated values at $p$ (the next pixel in the direction of the gradient) and $r$ (the previous pixel in the direction of the gradient). Interpolate as needed.\n4. Linking and thresholding\n\tTrying to fix broken edge chains by linking separate edge pixels through taking the normal of the gradient and linking it if the nearest interpolated pixel is also an edge pixel. Accept all edges over low threshold that are connect to an edge over high threshold.\n\t\n|Author|Approach|Detection|Localization|Single Resp|Limitations|\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n|Sobel|Gradient Magnitude Threshold|Good|Poor|Poor|Thick edges|\n|Marr/Hildreth|Zero-crossings of 2nd Derivative|Good|Good|Good|Smooths Corners\n|Canny|Local extrema of 1st Derivative|Best|Good|Good||\n\n### Boundary Detection\nHow closely do image edges correspond to boundaries that humans perceive to be salient or significant? \n\nOne approach is using circular windows of radii $r$ at each pixel $(x,y)$ cut in half by a line that bisects the circle in half. Then, compare visual features on both sides of the cut and if the features are statistically different, then the cut line probably corresponds to a boundary.\n\nFor statistical significance:\n1. Compute non-parametric distribution (histogram) for left side\n2. Compute non-parametric distribution (histogram) for right side\n3. Compare two histograms, on left and right side, using statistical test\n\nExample features include\n- Raw Intensity\n- Orientation Energy\n- Brightness Gradient\n- Color Gradient\n- Texture gradient\n\nFor this implementation, we consider 8 discrete orientations ($\\theta$) and 3 scales ($r$)\n\n### Features\nCorners are locally distinct 2D image features that (hopefully) correspond to a distinct position on a 3D object of interest in the scene.\n\nCannot be an edge as estimation of a location along an edge is close to impossible (the aperture problem)\n\n### Autocorrelation\nCorrelation of the image (distribution of pixel values) with itself. At each pixel, compute its partial derivative w.r.t. either the $x$ or the $y$ axis, $I_y = \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial y}, I_x = \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial x}$.\n\nWindows on an edge will have autocorrelation that falls of slowly in the direction of the edge but rapidly orthogonal to the edgge. Windows on a corder will have autocorrelation that falls off rapidly in all directions.\n\n#### Harris Corner Detection\nAs a stats reminder, covariance is the *direction* of the correlation. The closer the covariance is to 1, the closer it is to a perfect positive correlation. -1 implies perfect negative correlation.\n\nWhen drawing distrubtion, draw normals to edges going from low values (dark) to high values (white).\n\n1. Compute image gradients over small region\n2. Compute covariance matrix $$\\begin{bmatrix}\\sum_{p \\in P}I_xI_x \u0026 \\sum_{p \\in P}I_xI_y \\\\ \\sum_{p \\in P}I_yI_x \u0026 \\sum_{p \\in P}I_yI_y\\end{bmatrix}$$ (essentially fitting a quadratic to the gradients over the small image patch $P$)\n4. Computer eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix.\n5. Use threshold on eigenvalues to detect corners ($\u003e0$ is a corner)\n\nWe can visualize the covariance matrix $C$ as an ellipse whose axis lengths are determined by the eigenvalues and orientation determined by $R$ (the rotation matrix). It tells us the dispersion of the gradients nearby.\n\nAs $C$ is symmetric, we have the covariance matrix as the ellipse equation\n\n$$f(x,y) = \\begin{bmatrix}x \u0026 y\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}1 \u0026 0 \\\\ 0 \u0026 1\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}x \\\\ y\\end{bmatrix} = \\textrm{const}$$\n\nWhere the minor axis is $\\lambda_{max}^{-1/2}$ and the major axis is $\\lambda_{min}^{-1/2}$\n\nThen, this is what the eigenvalues tell us:\n- Case 1 (both $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$ are close to zero): flat region\n- Case 2 ($\\lambda_2$ is much greater than $\\lambda_1$): horizontal edge\n- Case 3 ($\\lambda_1$ is much greater than $\\lambda_2$): vertical edge\n- Case 4 ($\\lambda_1$ are both rather large $\\lambda_2$): corner\n\nTo threshold, we can pick a function\n1. Harris \u0026 Stephens: $\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 - \\kappa (\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2)^2$ which is equivalent to $\\det(C) - \\kappa \\textrm{trace}^2(C)$. $\\kappa$ is usually 0.4 or 0.6.\n2. Kanade \u0026 Tomasi: $\\min(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2)$\n3. Nobel: $\\frac{\\det(C)}{\\textrm{trace}(C)+\\epsilon}$\n\n#### Linear Algebra Aside/Review\nGiven a square matrix $A$, a scalar $\\lambda$ is called an **eigenvalue** of $A$ if there exists a nonzero vector $v$ that satisfies\n\n$$Av = \\lambda v$$\n\nThe vector $v$ is called an eigenvector for $A$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda$. The eigenvalues of $A$ are obtained by solving $\\det(A-\\lambda I) = 0$\n\n## Keypoint Description\n### Scale Invariant Features (SIFT)\nDavid Lowe\n\nInvariant to translation, rotation, scale, and other imaging parameters. (Generally works for about ~20% change in viewpoint angle)\n\nAdvantages:\n- Locality: features are local (robust to occlusion and clutter)\n- Distinctiveness: individual features can be matched to a large database of objects\n- Quantity: many features can be generated (even for small objects)\n- Efficiency: fast (close to real-time performance)\n\nDescribes both a **detector** and **descriptor**\n1. Multi-scale local extrema detection\n\t- Use difference of gradient pyramid (3 scales/octave, down-sample by a factor of 2 each octave)\n2. Keypoint localization\n\t- We then remove low constrast or poorly localized keypoints. We can determine good corners by using the covariance matrix! (Threshold on magnitude of extremum, ratio of principal curvatures)\n3. Orientation assignment\n\t- Create histogram of local gradient directions computed at selected scale multiplied by the gaussian kernel at the center\n\t- Assign canonical orientation at peak of smoothed histogram (mode)\n4. Keypoint description (SIFT Descriptor)\n\t- histogram of local gradient directions\n\t\t- (8x(4x4)) = 128 dims\n\t\t- 4x4 = 16 histograms\n\t\t- 8 orientations each\n\t- Normalized to unit length to reduce the effects of illumination change\n\tRobust to affine changes (rotation and scaling)\n\t\n### Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)\n- uses 8x8 cells and blocks which consist of 2x2 cells\n- then for each cell, create a histogram of 'unsigned' gradients\n\t- perform soft binning (adding to one bin also adds to neighbour bins)\n- concatenate then L2 normalize\n- 15x7x4x36 = 3780\n\n### 'Speeded Up' Robust Features (SURF)\n- 4x4 cell grid of 5x5 cells\n- each cell is represented by 4 values\n\t1. sum of all x derivatives\n\t2. sum of all y derivatives\n\t3. abs of 1\n\t4. abs of 2\n- use Haar wavelets filters (simple derivative filters where all black on one side and all white on the other, weighted by gaussian)\n- 4x4x4 = 64 dims\n\n## Object Recognition\n1. Match each keypoint to the database of keypoints\n\tTo find out probability of correct match, we can compare the ratio of distance between nearest neighbour and 2nd nearest neighbour. A threshold of 0.8 provides great separation.\n2. identify clusters of at least 3 features that agree on an object and pose\n\tLowe uses a generalized Hough transform\n3. check each cluster found by performing detailed geometric fit of affine transformation to the model\n4. accept/reject interpretation accordingly\n\t\n### Approximate Nearest Neighbour\n- generally, finding nearest neighbour in high-dimensional data is linear in time (even for KD trees)\n\n### Transformations\nDegrees of freedom (DOF)\n1. translation: 2\n2. rigid (euclidean): 3\n3. similarity: 4\n4. affine: 6\n5. projective: 8",

It has authoritative description and standard classification. \n\nIt should enable interactions that allow users to achieve their [goals](thoughts/design%20goals.md).\n\nWe organize\n- physical things (objects/artefacts)\n- information about physical things\n- digital things\n- information about digital things (metadata)\n\nGood organizing systems are\n1. Skimmable at different levels. Is there a 5s version? A 60s version?\n2. Transformable. Can the user transform the data into different representations without having to explicitly define these ahead of time?\n3. Context-sensitive. Not one size fits all, can we create unique content for every reader/reading depending on their prior understanding and current needs?\n4. Interrogable. Can we get clarifications and answers from the text without having the author having to anticipate those questions?\n\nThe document as an 'information container', but also a 'thing' which documents a thing. Data can be seen as 'elementary observations about properties of objects, events, and their environments'\n\nA set of resources is then transformed by an organizing system when the resources are described or arranged to enable interactions with them.\n\n### Tradeoffs\n\u003e The effectiveness of a system for accessing information is a direct function of the intelligence put into organizing it (Svenonius, 2000)\n\nThere are inherent tradeoffs in an organizing system, what is the goal? What are we optimizing for?\n\nSimilar to [research debt](thoughts/research%20debt.md) where there is no effort put into the initial organizational process so the mental burden of retrieving information is much higher.\n\n### Goals\n1. Storing\n2. Retrieving\n3. Minimizing effort to find (increased scale means increased difficulty of finding things)\n\nNot all users have the same goals! How do we address this?\n\n### Three Tiers of Organizing Systems\n1. User interface or presentation components where users or other applications interact with the data\n2. Business logic or functions that use the data\n3. Storage of data itself\n\n![Presentation, Logic, and Storage Tiers](https://berkeley.pressbooks.pub/app/uploads/sites/121/2020/04/Figure-1.2.jpg)\n\n### Design Heuristics\nSensemaking: organizing to derive meaning from experience by fitting new events of observations into what they already know\n\nQuestions to ask\n1. What? What is orgnaized, what type of resource or information object?\n2. Why? What are the goals of the system?\n3. How Much? How many different organization schemes are used?\n4. When? When is the organization of the resource imposed? At the creation of the resource?\n5. How, and by whom? Who is doing the organizaiton? Professional indexers? Algorithms?\n6. Where? Can be abstract ideas like the cloud or physical loike infrastructures and build environments.\n\nSimilar to the questions in the HCI [design requirements](thoughts/design%20requirements.md). When designing an organizing system, it is important to consider domain, scope, and scale.\n\n#### What\n1.  the scope and scale of the collection\n2.  the number and nature of users\n3.  the time span or lifetime over which the organizing system will operate\n4.  the physical or technological environment in which the organizing system is situated\n5.  the relationship of the organizing system to other ones that overlap with it in domain or scope\n\n### General organizing principles\n1. We organize collections of resources using the properties that are easiest to perceive, or whose values vary the most among the items in the collection\n2. We group together resources that we often use together\n3. We put rare or unique resources where we can protect them\n\nExamples of these are 1. alphabetical ordering or 2. chronological ordering\n\nThis scoping process is similar to the [double-diamond design](thoughts/design%20requirements.md) in [HCI](thoughts/human%20computer%20interaction.md).\n\n## The Filing Cabinet\n[Source](https://placesjournal.org/article/the-filing-cabinet-and-20th-century-information-infrastructure)\n\nThe shift from bound volumes (sets of books) to filing systems was extremely significant in the history of classification.\n\nThe currently accepted version of the filing cabinet is attributed to the Library Bureau, the Boston-based company founded in 1876 by Melvil Dewey (the guy who invented the Dewey decimal system)\n\nStill reinforced gendered division of labour though -- \"female file clerks were expected to handle papers, but not to understand their contents; in contrast, it was male managers and executives who read the files, performing jobs that purportedly required thought\"\n\nMostly made popular by efficiency, exploitation of gendered labour, anxiety over information loss, and granular certainty (wanting to break more and more of life into discrete, [quantized, and labelled](thoughts/quantization.md) parts)\n\n[Information](thoughts/information.md) then, was seen as something that could be standardized atomized, and stripped of context.\n\nNow though, the filing cabinet is \"no longer an exemplar of productivity and speed, the file cabinet now embodies the facility of bureaucracies to produce paper, to delay, to leave us waiting\" -- it can create an alternative paper-based reality to which officials reflexively defer.\n\nCuriously enough, piles of paper on a desktop can be both symbols of \"overwhelmed white collar worker confronted with information processing long coded as clerical\" but also \"exemplary information management practice\". In fact, a well-kept pile of papers can be more efficient than a linear index (very similar to the ethic of grab what you need and rely on internal organization than some explicit organizational system). Does this apply to the [Desktop Metaphor](thoughts/interaction%20design.md)?\n\nIs Google search the 21st century filing cabinet?",

It's \"a mixed blessing—one that resulted in technologies that have allowed many people to live longer, safer lives, but that has, simultaneously, destroyed global ecosystems, caused the extinction of many living species, facilitated rampant population growth, and wreaked havoc on climate systems, the effects of which will be an increase in droughts, floods, storms, and erratic weather patterns that threaten most global societies.\" [Source](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/09/the-industrial-revolution-and-its-discontents/379781/)\n\nThere are no 'thought leaders' in bleeding tech, only in established fields.

The main argument against it was that it implies a disrespect of previous generations.\n\nIs progress a result of a more creation focused lens rather than a [maintenance](thoughts/creation%20vs%20maintenance.md) focused one? Finding answers through working on new things rather than what was revealed in the past\n\nSo many historically 'truthful' sources like the Church and classical science were wrong about fundamental aspects of the universe (e.g. Earth being the centre of the universe). \"By 1600, much of ancient wisdom had crumbled.\"\n\nSkepticism as the taproot of all knowledge, heavily [Cartesian](thoughts/virtual%20worlds.md)\n\nHowever, [[thoughts/writing|writing]], the printing press, and other tools allowed us to [extend our mind](thoughts/Extended%20Mind%20Hypothesis.md) and conceive of knowledge as **cumulative**.\n\n## Progress Studies\nThe study of the *how* and *why* of progress.\n\nThere are ecosystems that are better at generating progress than others, perhaps by orders of magnitude.

Users are chosen to become validators pseudo-randomly depending on various factors like size of stake, age of stake, etc. Validators check for validity of transactions, signing the block, and adding to the chain. Reward for the validator is the transaction fees.\n\nThe stake is a financial motivator for users not to validate or create fraudulent transactions (i.e. if you care about the chain, you should hope that members of the chain are also honest, mutual [trust](thoughts/trust.md)) \n\nThis validation is known as attesting. You can think of attesting as saying \"this block looks good to me.\" If you attest to malicious blocks, you lose your stake. 128 validators are required to attest to a block to achieve finality on it -- this 128 is known as the committee. The committee works on 32 blocks or 'slots' before disbanding -- this duration is known as an epoch.\n\n[Source: Ethereum Wiki](https://eth.wiki/en/concepts/proof-of-stake-faqs)\n\nTLDR; a set of validators take turns proposing and voting on the next block, and the weight of each validator’s vote depends on the size of its deposit (i.e. stake)\n\nOne of the alternatives to [PoW](thoughts/proof%20of%20work.md)\n\n\u003e Security comes from putting up economic value-at-loss rather than straight up burning energy (however, this doesn't take into account collusion)\n\n## Losing Stake\nFor example, a user can lose a portion of their stake for things like going offline (failing to validate) or their entire stake for deliberate collusion.\n\n## Disadvantages\n- Greater chance of [51% attacks](thoughts/fault%20tolerance.md)\n\t- Though this is questionable, 51% means you need to control 51% of the staked ETH which would probably cause ETH's value to drop significantly.

The internet's so-called \"[public spaces](thoughts/digital%20commons.md)\" are nothing like our cities' public parks. They are merely someone else's private server, where access can be revoked at will.\n\nPublic also means creating venues in which people could begin to identify themselves as part of a collective whole.\n\n\u003e To publish a web document or software application is more than making _something_ public: it's an act of making _a_ public (Warner, 2002)\n\n### Defining 'good'\n\"_Why_ are public parks more desirable than public parking lots? This brings us to an important realization: any definition of public goods presupposes a shared understanding of what is in the public's benefit, and why.\"\n\nThese 'goods' exemplify a set of shared values within the 'public'.\n\nAre there concepts of 'free riders' with public goods? What about [tragedy of the commons](thoughts/tragedy%20of%20the%20commons.md)? \"It is clearly in the interest of society to promote the creation and consumption of public goods—be they vaccines, public libraries, or open source code\"\n\n### Economical\nPublic goods are\n1. non-excludable: it’s extremely difficult to stop someone from using the good, like roads and bridges\n2. non-rivalrous:  it’s abundant, and one person’s use of the good doesn’t substantially reduce the amount left for someone else (e.g. there’s more than enough air to go around)\n\nStatic [open source](thoughts/Making%20and%20Maintenance%20of%20OSS.md) (code that anyone can copy off the internet) is an example of a public good. Another example of these are public [infrastructure](thoughts/infrastructure.md) like roads (although not necessarily, if you have your drivers license revoked you may not be able to make use of the roads in the first place).\n\nIt seems only natural that online media archives and open digital [infrastructure](thoughts/infrastructure.md) should qualify as well.\n\nYet, no matter their claim to universality, instantiations of public goods are always _local_. The public cannot contain everyone. Locality is created and felt through [shared space, time, or experience]. It requires synchronicity of experience, rel: [group limits](thoughts/group%20limits.md)\n\nClub goods are excludable but non-rivalrous. A lot of more recent app launches (e.g. Dispo and Clubhouse) used waitlists to create 'fake scarcity' to transition from a public good to a club good.\n\nRelated: [positive sum worlds](thoughts/positive%20sum.md)\n\n## [Web3](thoughts/web3.md)\nhttps://otherinter.net/research/positive-sum-worlds/\n\nCrypto protocols are one of the most compelling novel institutional forms, specifically deriving from their \"public\" qualities\n1. unrestricted membership + participation\n2. open APIs\n3. transparent allocation of resources and pwoer\n\nYet not perfect\n* Ownership of these resources are concentrated in a precious few (whales)\n* The 'public' that this infrastructure serves is mostly decentralized finance\nBoth of these main tokeholders share one common concern: price\n\n### 'Voice' in web3\n\"The equivalence of stake and voice in crypto is reminiscent of early American democracy, in which political representation was conditioned on property ownership. Under this regime, only 6% of the total US population was eligible to vote—a laughably exclusionary idea of the body politic by today's standards (Ratcliffe, 2013)\"\n\n\"The most consequential members of the crypto-public today are those who hold the most tokens, meaning even small holders are effectively removed from the conversation about what's in their benefit.\" Same concepts as [design justice](thoughts/Design%20Justice.md), we need to talk with and consider the marginalized peoples under existing systems of power so we can gain a deeper understanding of the public that we are building for and how to best serve them.\n\n## Obessions with profit\nWeb3 supposed allows us to 'codify' the set of values that a public goods represents. Yet, in practice in web3, \"little space has been made for different values to be discussed or enacted.

I very much subscribed to the belief that if I just kept constantly producing new things, I would eventually learn from my mistakes and improve rapidly. I found that while, yes, this approach allowed me to build my technical skills really quickly, I applied it to everything — even things that didn't need it. I held a metaphorical hammer in my hands and everything seemed like a nail.\n\nOver the summer, I began to read again. I started with technical write-ups, fiction novels, traversed into self-help, and to memoirs. I started to read more about the state of the world and critically discuss these with family and friends. Reading helped me colour in the lines as to [*why* we need to build](thoughts/value%20setting.md) in the first place. I realized that the problems we try so hard to solve with technology are not tech problems, but human ones.\n\nI've started to write more about these ideas, at first to help me organize my own thoughts, but eventually segued into an excuse for me to talk to people about interesting ideas and get their perspective. It's started a sort of chain reaction in a sense, with an observation from a book leading to a conversation with a friend to a blog post ad infinitum — leading me to be a more informed and curious individual.\n\n",

Nothing could be more different from the news feed, where these aspects of information—provenance, trustworthiness, or what the hell it’s even about—are neither internally coherent nor subject to my judgment.

Descartes says: “To begin with, I acknowledge that it is impossible for God ever to deceive me, for trickery or deception is always indicative of some imperfection” (p. 36) Śiva leans back and smirks. “Now THAT,” he says, “is impressive. I’ve managed to so thoroughly deceive myself that I think I can’t be a deceiver!” God looks sideways at Śiva and responds, “What are you on about? This is one of the greatest moments of insight that one of my creatures has had! Because Descartes clearly and distinctly perceives that I am not a deceiver, he opens himself to all knowledge!” “Oh really?,” Śiva responds. “I thought Descartes already had the key to all knowledge just in the realization ‘I exist.’ He just needs to understand what that means about his own nature!” God pushes pause on the Cosmicflix show and, with a sweep of his arm, transforms their surroundings to a formal debate platform. “OK,” God says, “Time to get to the bottom of what self-knowledge even is. Do you accept the challenge?” “Bring it,” says Śiva, with a grin.\n\n---\n\n- **G:** God, the Creator of all things\n- **S:** Śiva, the Ultimate Reality, the consciousness from which all else springs\n\n**G:** Wonderful. Now, let us first set the ground and define some terminology.\n\n**S:** As one should always do when debating.\n\n**G:** I posit that self-knowledge is the knowledge of one's own mental states. This means that one should be able to know what the 'self' constitutes, and to know one's experiences, propositional attitudes, etc.\n\n**S:** This sounds reasonable but hinges on how you define \"one's own\". What does it mean to distinguish between one consciousness and another? I posit that, well, Descartes is actually me.\n\n**G:** I am confused.\n\n**S:** You must remember that, outside of Cosmicflix binging series, I am Śiva, the ultimate reality. I am a sculptor of sorts as I can create and carve worlds from myself. Conventional reality is created through my act of *apoha* or exclusion. So all of the world that Descartes lives in, including himself is actually something I have created. Descartes' conventional sense of personal identity is also conceptual and made through this process of exclusion as well (Torella, p. 132).\n\nLet me rephrase my question. Seeing as you are also the Creator of all things, did you not consider all of your creations extensions of your self?\n\n**G:** Ah I see your question. Though I too have sculpted Descartes in my image, I do not see him as a part of myself.\n\n**S:** But doesn't his existence depend on you creating him? My ascertainment of something being a 'jar' is brought about by the free knowing subject and existence of the polarization of 'non-jar' things (Torella, p. 129-131). This act of chiselling is just sculpting the world from the same block of marble -- the same body of consciousness -- is it not?\n\n**G:** No. Creation, to me, does not imply me carving them out of my consciousness. Just as I can create mountain and forest who are not part of my conscious being, so too can I create other conscious beings.\n\nDescartes is this own conscious being. He has actually ascertained this himself through his Second Meditation.\n\n*[G presses play on the show and continues talking.]*\n\nFor Descartes, [the self](thoughts/the%20Self.md) is the thinking being. This was what his statement *“cogito, ergo sum”* posits (Descartes, p. 18-19). Existence must necessarily be true whenever it is put forward by me or conceived in my mind. In this second meditation, Descartes explores the concept of the \"I\" quite clearly, eventually resolving that both soul and body can be deceptions (p. 18-19) and only thought, above all else, is inseparable from the existence of the self (p. 20).\n\n*[S pauses the show once again.]*\n\n**S:** Okay, even if you don't subscribe to the fact that Descartes is actually a subset of the ultimate reality, how can Descartes be so certain that he cannot be deceived? If you have endowed him with infallible judgment, how is it that he can be mistaken, as he undoubtedly is from time to time?\n\n**G:** Well, this is not something I can control. I give humans free will to think and judge and that is what allows them to err. Descartes himself also came to this conclusion in his mediations. \"The will is free to affirm or deny whatever it wishes – as such, free will is the source of error... If there was no free will, we would never make mistakes.\" (Descartes, p. 39-40).\n\nThe idea of God (me) exists as an idea in Descartes' mind and he clearly and distinctly perceives all of my qualities. \n\nOne of these qualities of perfection is existence, then God would not be God if he did not exist -- just as a triangle only exists if it has the property of being three-sided (Descartes, p. 46-47).\n\nThus, he concludes, I must exist and have these perfect qualities. In doing so, I cannot deceive him (as deception is evil) so his perceptions are accurate. Any missteps he makes are due to overstep in judgement.\n\n**S:** Ah see now that Descartes does not have the key to *all knowledge* but rather just the ability to know that one must exist and the freedom to be able to judge the world for themselves. Hmm, this seems ok... for now. Let us return to the show.\n\n*[S presses play on the Cosmicflix show again.]*\n\n---\n\n## Week 6 Short-answer for PHIL240A\n\nAnswer this question from the perspectives of both Descartes and Pratyabhiñā thinkers.\n\n\u003e What, if anything, about self-knowledge is trustworthy?\n\nFrom the perspective of Cartesian thinkers, both soul and body are not necessarily trustworthy, but thought is. A Cartesian thinker is one who understands the Meditator, who is in turn sure of their own thoughts. To even have doubts or to be deceived, one must first exist. Thus, above all else, thought is inseparable from being. Then, the 'self' is only a thing that thinks (Descartes, p. 18-19) and thus is a trustworthy indicator of the self existing.\n\nThen, Descartes goes on to extend this by attempting to prove the existence of God. The rationale here surrounds the fact that God is *infinitely* perfect and has infinite substance (the most real) -- necessary existence cannot be separated from the essence of a supremely perfect being. As no effect can have a greater amount of reality than its cause combined with the fact that you can’t actually get the idea of infinity just from endlessly increasing what’s finite, the infinite must independently exist (Descartes, p. 32).\n\nThus, Cartesian thinkers conclude, if deception is imperfect and God exists and is perfect, God cannot deceive. The things I perceive \"clearly and distinctly\" must be true and cannot be deceiving us about basic universal truths (e.g. a square has four sides) and methods of logical deduction (if p then q).\n\n---\n\nPratyabhiñā thinkers on the other hand, believe that *all* knowledge is self-knowledge as everything is carved from the ultimate reality Śiva. They posit that only consciousness can present itself as precisely what it’s not while still remaining itself. Contrary to insentient objects,\" consciousness is capable of changing without perishing\" (Ratie p. 441).\n\nExternality, then, is made on the basis of differentiating internal appearances, in order for Śiva to be able to experience the effects of the created objects (Torella p. 149). This creates a basic divide between self and world. Even the mere appearance of an external world to an embodied subject is the result of this exclusion (*apoha*). My ascertainment of something being a 'jar' is brought about by the free knowing subject and existence of the polarization of 'non-jar' things (Torella, p. 129-131)\n\nAs all objects and subjects rest in Siva, there is one underlying unitary consciousness.\n\n[^1]: This content is sourced from Professor [Evan Thompson](https://evanthompson.me/)'s course materials for PHIL451A at UBC.

We tend to over engineer our systems and never need to explain the inner workings to anyone who is non-technical. This isn't restricted to just software engineers, of course. Any sufficiently advanced technology is difficult to explain in terms a non-expert can understand. But we do, at least, understand that we need to tailor the front-end user experience to the target demographic.\"\n\nCurious how this ties into the [over simplification of user interfaces](/thoughts/books/mindstorms#Microworlds and simplification)\n\n\"Blockchain vot**ing fails at the most basic test of social technology: can you explain how it works to someone skeptical of the people in power in a way that makes them trust the system?\"\n\n## Values and Technology\n\u003e \"Technology is the result of human imagination – of human beings envisioning alternatives to the status quo and acting upon the environment with the materials at hand to change the conditions of human and non-human life.

Tacit knowledge isn't easy to share. An expert will relate some simple-sounding rule of thumb, but then grilling them on specific cases will quickly uncover a huge collection of exceptions and caveats that vary depending on the specific details of the situation.\n\nIt's so easy to think that simple solutions exist. But if you look at the history of ideas that actually worked, they tend to only be simple from a distance. The closer you get, the more you notice that the working idea is surrounding by a huge number of almost identical ideas that don't work. Take bicycles, for example. They seem simple and obvious, but it took [two centuries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_bicycle) to figure out all the details and most people today [can't actually locate the working idea](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03195929.pdf) amongst its neighbours. Even when old niche ideas make a comeback (eg neural networks) it's not because they were right all along but because someone recognized the limitations and found a new variation on the idea that overcame them (eg deep learning). Finding the idea that actually works amidst the sea of very similar ideas that don't work requires staying curious long enough to encounter the fine-grained detail of reality and humble enough to recognize and learn from each failure.\n\nMainstream is mainstream for a reason. The frontier is the place to go mining for new ideas, but it's 1% gold and 99% mud.",

I think this is such an interesting case study because the game itself is perma-death, meaning that items on characters are permanently deleted/lost on a character death.\n\nSoulbound is an interesting mechanic that has had a lot of implications for gameplay and in-game economy:\n\n- Players cannot trade these items. This incentivizes participation for actual gameplay loops + events\n\t- For example, when the game decides to host an event by boosting item drop rates for certain dungeons, people actually just play the game more rather than accumulating wealth and just buying the items off of farmers seeking to make a profit\n- However, this enables a secondary (illicit) market that trades *accounts* rather than items. This only accounts for a very small minority of trades as the average user does not use more than a single account\n- There is certain prestige that comes with owning certain items (e.g. \u003c1% drop rate from one of the most difficult dungeons in the game)\n\t- This is a visual signifier for one of three things: skill, veterancy, or dedication\n- As a result, organized groups for running hard and dangerous dungeons have emerged, with highly coordinated Discord servers with bots for managing headcount and role distribution (we need 2 healers! 5 people who can boost our damage!)\n\t- Some of the more elite groups actually have very strict requirements for entry (need to have 3 characters at the strongest stat cap, activity requirements, etc.)\n\t- All of these are volunteer run\n\nBy keeping the most prestigious items *untradeable*, it incentivizes more community involvement and recognition/prestige around the activities that yield those items. A lot of these items are extremely powerful and enable incredibly unique capabilities for characters. But as the game is permadeath, not a lot of individuals have the guts to use these regularly.",

Upon their arrival, the villagers are unwilling to share any of their food stores with the very hungry travelers. Then the travelers go to a stream and fill the pot with water, drop a large stone in it, and place it over a fire. One of the villagers becomes curious and asks what they are doing. The travelers answer that they are making \"stone [soup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soup \"Soup\")\", which tastes wonderful and which they would be delighted to share with the villager, although it still needs a little bit of garnish, which they are missing, to improve the flavor.\n\u003e \n\u003e The villager, who anticipates enjoying a share of the soup, does not mind parting with a few carrots, so these are added to the soup. Another villager walks by, inquiring about the pot, and the travelers again mention their stone soup which has not yet reached its full potential. More and more villagers walk by, each adding another ingredient, like potatoes, onions, cabbages, peas, celery, tomatoes, sweetcorn, meat, milk, butter, salt, and pepper. Finally, the stone (being inedible) is removed from the pot, and a delicious and nourishing pot of soup is enjoyed by travelers and villagers alike. Although the travelers have thus tricked the villagers into sharing their food with them, they have successfully transformed it into a tasty meal which they share with the donors.\n\n\nProperly seeding new initiatives to set the expectations for future potential contributors.\n\nPreventing the [cold-start problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_start_(recommender_systems))",

Sheridan (1992) originally dubbed “Supervisory Control”: a type of control in which only goals and high level commands are communicated to the slave robot.\n        -   how is this different from telerobotics?\n    -   in principle, telerobotics systems need not feel more alien than teleoperated systems to the conscious users, however this is not the case in practice. closely coupled teleoperated systems seem to much better induce the feeling of actual telepresense more effectively\n        -   what seems to be important is the presense of some kind of local, circular [feedback loop](thoughts/feedback%20loops.md) in which neural commands, motor actions, and sensory feedback are closely and continuously correlated\n            -   temporal disruptions (like lag) may break this 'illusion'\n    -   the brain uses a special piece of neural circuitry known as a motor emulator\n        -   This is a little circuit that takes a copy of the motor signal to the hand (say) and feeds it into a neural system which has learned about the typical responses from the bodily peripheries which are likely to ensue. The emulator is thus like a little local scale model of the real circuit. It rapidly outputs a prediction of the signals that should soon be arriving from the bodily peripheries, and these are then used instead of the real thing. This emulator-based feedback is then used for ongoing error-connection and smoothing\n    -   explaining why the apparent telerobotics that we as humans actually perform seem to not suffer from the sensation that our body, while performing the action sequences, we are somehow less than fully in control of ourselves\n        -   one possible explanation is that own detailed bodily motions retain a sense of unfolding and possible intervention\n            -   unfolding → rich array of sensory feedback as the action is ongoing\n            -   potential intervention → i can just consciously stop",

It ain’t what you say, it’s the way that you say it, and the [context](thoughts/context.md) in which you say it. Words are how you use them.\n\nyet usage changes over time\nno one person or institution decides how language works: it is one of the few logically decentralized aspects of humanity\n\nold meanings may no longer make sense. new groups try to co-opt old terminology. we accrue a plurality of definitions\n\nwhen do we need new words?\n\n## Terminological anchoring\nnatural meaning 'drift'\n\n- hesitant to 'root' new terms, terminology evolves in a decentralized way, centralizing meaning often concretizes meaning (which is good in the case of dictionaries but i dont think web3 is at that stage yet)\n- naming as power, but naming also anchors meaning\n\n## Definition overloading\n- term overloading\n\t- i think my worry with a 'standard library' is that there is no one 'unified' interpretation of a single concept, how will it adapt to usage overtime? wouldnt this anchor thought patterns to a shared 'truth'?\n\t- \"By changing what we were, you change what we are and what we are going to be.\" erasure through terminology change -\u003e essentially just cooptation?\n\t- \"Thus potential sources of uncertainty and misunderstanding arise in the form of homonyms (i.e. words that are used to denote more than one concept) and synonyms (i.e. more than one word for the same concept).\" [Source](https://philosophyforchange.wordpress.com/2014/03/11/meaning-is-use-wittgenstein-on-the-limits-of-language/?curius=1294)\n\ndo we need new words?\ne.g. hacker, metaverse\n\nat nwplus, we have a slide on all our promo materials that explains that hackers don't actually 'hack devices' at hackathons\n\n## Right to be forgotten\n- right to be forgotten but for terminology\n\t- rel: [digital permanence](thoughts/digital%20permanence.md)\n\nhard for things ingrained within society\nmeaning is not dictated by some central organization\nit needs to be collectively forgotten, and/or overwritten\n\neither hard-fork it within a subcommunity\nor create an entirely new word\n\n## Terminological [Feedback Loops](thoughts/feedback%20loops.md)\n1.

Arguments ensue over updating shared terminology (esp as language is decentralized, this can cause fracturing)\n5. Two camps emerge\n\t1. People who want to use terminology mainly as a means to more efficiently communicate practice\n\t2. People who like the theory behind terminology or those who are attached to tradition\n6.

    "content": "\nRelated: [Extended Mind Hypothesis](thoughts/Extended%20Mind%20Hypothesis.md), [Networked thought](posts/networked-thought.md), [interaction design](thoughts/interaction%20design.md)\n\nQuestions:\n1. How can we create tools that aid our thinking?\n2. As an extension, how do we organize the abundance of [information](thoughts/information.md) we have today so that it is both accessible and useful?\n3. How do we distill all the [research debt](thoughts/research%20debt.md) so that our ideas are easily useful to others?\n4. How can we make mixed media first-class? Allow drawing, images, and video? Bring back the overhead projector!\n\nCan we do this on a browser-level rather than just a standalone app? Building in curius.app-esque support, annotations, note-taking, etc. Minimize context switching\n\n## Word Charcuterie Board\nIs there any way to rearrange the fuzzy cloud of ideas in our head easily on paper/screens?\n\nHow can we 'cut' text without being afraid of it being lost forever?

These tools are a [public good](thoughts/public%20goods.md). They are, quite literally, the [infrastructure](thoughts/infrastructure.md) for mental representations and operations. These are the patterns the dictate our very mental processes.\n\n## Memex\n\u003e device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it can be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility.\n\nBush envisioned the memex behaving like an “intricate web of trails” similar to the function of the human mind, which he believed works by a method of “association” and not via an alphabetical index. According to Levy (2008, 508), the most “innovative feature” of Bush’s memex system was the establishing of associative indices between portions of microfilmed text—what we now call hypertext links—so that researchers could follow trails of useful information through masses of literature.\n\n## Kernel\n[Source: Remember in *Kernel*](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-3/remember)\n\nWe live in an [information](thoughts/information.md) age.

Then, the path through these ideas can be thought of as 'user trails'. \n\n### Chunking\nWe naturally group things into patterns and chunks and allow us to think on and rationalize at higher levels of abstraction, descending into lower levels only when we need to.\n\nThis was demonstrated by chess masters in the 1970's: \"Players learn to recognize somewhere between 25,000 and 100,000 **patterns of chess pieces**. These much more elaborate 'chunks' are combinations of pieces that the players **perceive as a unity**, and are able to reason about at a higher level of abstraction than the individual pieces\"\n\nIs it possible to automatically pick up repeated digital [desire paths](thoughts/desire%20paths.md) of user trails and pull them into [workflows](thoughts/workflows.md)? take advantage of natural spaced repetition to identify saliency\n\nThe focus of modern information systems is moving from \"data-processing\" towards \"concept-processing\", meaning that the basic unit of processing is less and less an atomic piece of data and is becoming more a semantic concept which caries an interpretation and exists in a [context](thoughts/context.md) with other concepts.\n\n[Source: Automated knowledge discovery in advanced knowledge management](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220363565_Automated_knowledge_discovery_in_advanced_knowledge_management)\n\nAre there ways to 'breadcrumb' how we navigate? Even something as simple as option+click to leave a crumb and when finishing a session, you can save parts of the trail as a flow.\n\n### Spatial\nCan we create spatial reminders that adhere to their contexts? Sticky notes for our mind? A reminder in certain notes to come back later and add to it, etc. Can we build [memory palaces](thoughts/memory%20palace.md)? Spatial representations of information? (See https://nototo.app/)\n\n### Emotion\nVideo is incredibly expressive. You can *feel* the passion of people who really care about the things they study, build, and work on.\n\nIs it possible to create mediums for thought that convey 'awe and mystery and surprise and beauty'? I really hope so.\n\n### Execution\nCan we embed computation into our notes? Create APIs out of our thoughts and concepts? Compose theorems just as easily as we chain function calls?\n\n## Activism\n[Source: On Gathering, *Mindy Seu*](https://www.shiftspace.pub/on-gathering-mindy-seu)\n\nMemory work of this sort is also a form of activism. Whose memories are saved and retold to future generations?\n\nAfter a conversation, all parties maintain ownership of what transpired, and they continue to hold ties to one another.

On a very basic level, transparency allows access to more information which can influence power relationships between governments and citizens, business and customers, and in our case between news outlets and audiences (Bennis 2013). The access to more information also reduces uncertainty in social relations and theoretically increases trust (Cotterrell 1999), which is crucial in the maintenance of a functional society (Fukuyama 1995).\n- But while transparency can be seen as beneficial to engendering trust, seeing the inner workings of a government, business, or newsroom can result in negative implications such as undermining competitive advantages or creating costs without concomitant gains (Granados and Gupta 2013).\n- Challenges\n\t- what would motivate a news or media organization to disclose details about their algorithms? Costs identified in producing transparency information included: data preparation, documentation writing, source code polishing, and benchmark testing. “How does being transparent offset loss of revenue?\"\n\t- Participants also suggested that disclosing aspects of how a proprietary algorithmic system works may hurt an organization’s technological competitive advantage, or open the system to manipulation by third parties. Yet it was recognized that people will game the system no matter what, and that by disclosing information publicly it would level the playing field or, as one participant (CS2) put it, “everybody has the same chance now because we all know the rules of the game.”\n\nCited as:\n\n\u003e Diakopoulos, N., \u0026 Koliska, M.

In a fearful society; love and trust are the primary tools of resistance.\n\n[Source: *Kernel* on Trust](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-0/trust)\n\n\u003e Trust is only meaningful once we have fully understood how people can lie.\n\nHaving clearly defined and encoded rules means that there is an *implicit shift* from trusting those who own the medium to those who are transacting. In essense, trusting peers rather than a regulatory power.\n\nThis feels like its missing an important step in the process: trusting the medium. If people don't understand how the medium works to facilitate transactions, how can they trust it? Not only is **access** important, but how easily people understand why it works.\n\nCurious whether this has relations to [philosophy of science](thoughts/philosophy%20of%20science.md) and [Cartesian skepticism](thoughts/Descartes'%20Meditations.md)\n\nRelated: [game theory and trust](thoughts/game%20theory.md), [[thoughts/PHIL240A Final Paper|PHIL240A Final Paper]]\n\n\u003e To dream up important ideas you must think like an idealist; to build systems that will live up to those dreams, you must think like an adversary.\n\n### [Money](thoughts/money.md) as Faith\nWhat you believe informs what you pay attention to and how you act, which define what you vest value in.\n\n## Web3\n\"Because [blockchain](thoughts/blockchain.md)s allow us to define succinctly our shared truths, **and because the record itself is shared** across all participants, there is a whole new \"trust space\" we can explore, searching for more valuable kinds of transactions impossible within merely legal fictions.\"\n\n## Trust as an Unquestioning Attitude\n*C. Thi Nguyen*\n\n\"We inhabit trust like we inhabit the air, and we only notice it when it has departed.\"\n\n\u003e Most theories of trust presume that trust is a conscious attitude that can be directed at only other agents. I sketch a different form of trust: the unquestioning attitude. What it is to trust, in this sense, is not simply to rely on something, but to rely on it unquestioningly. It is to rely on a resource while suspending deliberation over its reliability\n\n### Baier's Goodwill Theory\nColloquial use of \"trust\" blurs together two very distinct concepts\n- Mere reliance: depending on something\n- Attitude of trust: depend in some more normatively loaded manner\n\t- E.g. failing to show up after having promised to do so: \"I had trusted you and you let me down\"\n\t- Generally applies to things/people within our integrative stance -- things we take to be part of us and towards things with which we are supposed to be integrating to form some larger whole\n\t- The normativity here arises, not from there being any moral commitments in play, but from teleological integration: \"The external objects that evoke the strongest sense of betrayal are those whose functions are most tightly integrated into our own thinking and functioning\"\n\nQuestion: can objects be trusted in the normative sense? Can we feel betrayed by objects?\n\nThis involves ascribing goodwill to the trusted and the sense of betrayal comes from discovery that there is no such goodwill after all.\n\n### Responsiveness Theories\nThinking that the fact that you trust in them/it will give a reason to fulfill that trust.\n\n\u003e a trustworthy person “takes the fact that they are counted on to be a reason for acting as counted on” (Jones 2012, 66)\n\nBetrayal of trust here is failure to be properly responsive\n\nHawley's definition of trust is that \"to trust somebody is to take them to have made a commitment to do something and to rely on them to fulfill that commitment. Hawley's account grounds the sence of betrayal in the trusted person's failure to live up to their commitments\"\n\n### Non-agent based theories\nYet all of these theories share the presumption of agent-directedness or [intentionality](thoughts/intentionality.md).\n\nRelated, [agential gullibility and the Extended mind Hypothesis](thoughts/Extended%20Mind%20Hypothesis.md)\n\n\u003e \"The veteran also suffers from a problem of trust, a building block on which all of social life is erected. The everyday, taken-for-granted reality of civilian life ignores much; civility assumes the nonlethal intentions of others. In war, however, all such assumptions evaporate: one cannot trust the ground one walks on, the air one breathes, nor can one expect with full assuredness that tomorrow will come again.\" (Kearl 1989, 353)\n\u003e ...\n\u003e The fact that many philosophers find it odd to speak of being betrayed by their environment is perhaps best explained by the fact that most philosophers have lead, by and large, pretty cushy lives.\n\nInteresting to distinguish between what we are trusting when we trust designed (e.g. search engines, devices, websites, etc.) and non-designed objects (the ground, physics, etc.)\n\nTo lose trust is to shift from the unquestioning state to the endlessly skeptical and suspicious mood.\n\nPHIL 240A Assignment 1: [Trust as Unquestioning Attitude](thoughts/Trust%20as%20Unquestioning%20Attitude.md)\n\n## Partiality and prejudice in trusting\n*By Katherine Hawley*\n\n\u003e Is it reasonable to trust your [friends](thoughts/friendship.md)?\n\nCommon definition of trust:\n- involves relying on them to do it\n- an extra factor which distinguishes genuine trust from the attitude of mere reliance we take to inanimate objects\n\nInterestingly, there is a gap between relying on someone to do something and believing that they will do it\n- Trust is a choice -- so \"trusting someone to do something need not involve belief that she is trustworthy, nor belief that she will do what she is trusted to do, nor even belief that it is likely she will do it\"\n- You can trust someone to do something without relying on them to do it\n\t- I can trust my friends to keep my secrets by not believing that they *won't* keep my secrets\n- You can rely on them without trusting them\n\t- I can rely on my neighbour to tidy the garden we share but I don't trust her to do so (nor distrust) -- I would feel disappointed but not resentful if she didn't do the job\nTrust doesn't require *active knowledge* -- checking whether $x$ will $p$ is unnecessary when I already *know* whether $x$ will $p$\n\nStroud (2006) and Kelly (2004) argue that we *should* have partiality towards friends not only in actions but beliefs as well, though this isn't always the right thing to do. As Stroud says, 'friendship requires epistemic irrationality'\n- Confirmation [bias](thoughts/bias.md): tendency to notice evidence which confirms our existing beliefs (that our friends are indeed good people)\n- May resist bad news that undermines a shared history of friendship (sunk cost fallacy)\n\t- \"should we quietly drop the friend, provoke a confrontation, or accept a continuing friendship contaminated with doubts?\"\n\nThe considerations are all in some sense selfish—they play on our wish to be right, to have been right, to be a good judge of character, and to avoid difficult situations.\n\nExploring potential conflicts between different types of trust\n1. Epistemic Trust: trust in someone as a speaker or source of knowledge\n2. Practical Trust: trust in someone as an actor\n\nIn fact, there is often a two-way [[thoughts/causality|causal]] interaction between friendship and trustworthiness. Roughly, people are more likely to behave in a trust-worthy manner towards their friends, and we are more likely to form friendships with people we consider trustworthy. Clearly, there are exceptions\n1. Friend might let you down instead of disappointing someone else as your friend hopes you will understand and forgive them\n2. Might find it more tempting to lie about some matters because they are concerned about maintaining a good image of themselves in your mind\nBut if she takes these liberties too often, you will feel you have been taken for granted, and come to resent your friend. **Friendship requires mutual respect and openness as well as forgiveness.**\n\nStroud's 4 demands of friendship\n1. Serious scrutiny: scrutinize negative claims about our friends\n2. Different conclusions: draw different conclusions and make difference inferences than they otherwise would about non-friends given the same information\n3. Interpretive Charity: interpret evidence against friends more charitably than with non-friends\n4. Reason: treat the fact someone is a friend as a reason when we believe about them\n\n## Trust Circles\nFrom [Buzzard](https://buzzard.life/posts/kristen/buzzard-squad-as-cell/)\n\n![Trust circles](thoughts/images/Trust%20Circles.png)\n\n## Trust between human and non-human systems\n\nTrust has historically distinguished from *mere reliance* (Baier, 1986, p. 242) through an attitude of trust or extra factors which distinguish genuine trust from mere reliance (Hawley, 2014, p. 1) that we take to inanimate objects. However, algorithms and computerized decision making systems are beginning to play larger roles in our society -- deciding jail time for criminals, giving medical diagnoses, and many more. How should we weigh the epistemic authority or trustworthiness of human versus non-human expert systems?\n\nI posit that, until these algorithmic systems are able to reliably be held accountable for their decision making, they should not be epistemologically load-bearing. These systems should *supplement* human decision making rather than be considered an epistemic authority in and of itself. Let us construct a case study to examine this in more detail.\n\nSuppose you are a hiring manager at a tech company. There is a potential candidate in the pipeline for you company that you are very on the fence about whether to hire or not. She has an incredibly strong 'yes' recommendation from a more senior hiring manager. You don't know this higher up very well but you know that her and this candidate are close friends already. On the other hand, the company uses an internal AI-powered candidate ranking system. This system is quite complex and the original engineers who designed it have since long left the company. This system gives this candidate a strong 'no' hire recommendation.\n\nIn this situation, both systems are 'authorities', having been approved by the company for use in the hiring process. The more senior hiring manager is clearly an expert, having been working in this company and hiring many stellar employees in the past. The algorithm can also be considered an expert here, having scored extremely highly on tests of accuracy in predicting based off of historical data whether candidates will do well in the company. It has been vetted for internal use.\n\nHowever, it is important to note here that in the case example, while *both* systems are potentially biased, it is far more likely that the algorithmic system is biased.\n\nThe senior hiring manager could potentially be doxastically partial towards her friend but not because it is normative to be always partial to our friends. Notably, Crawford defines being a good friend constitutively involving forming attitudes about one’s friends that are appropriately responsive to the features that one’s friends have that appear to warrant those attitudes (2019, p. 1). It is unknown to you whether the senior hiring manager has any state-given reason to highly recommend her friend, so we cannot assume this to be the case as it is an unbased claim (as we have no evidence to believe so). Thus, we have solid reason to assume that the manager's friend actually *does* have those features that she believes makes them such a good candidate.\n\nHowever, there is one clear detail in this case that makes the algorithmic expert far more likely to be biased: it is trained on historical data that has been sanitized and decontextualized. In fact, historical data shows that in the past there have been more men in the women in the workforce. The *forbidden base rate* (Gendler, 2011) here is the statistical information about the relative number of male and female employees in the tech industry. If the data was sampled at random, then it is *statistically optimal* for the algorithm to prefer male applicants to female applicants rather than purely on the basis of qualification for the position. This, while *epistemically* rational, may not be the correct choice of action for moral reasons.\n\nLastly, I put forth the concept of epistemic accountability, a measure of whether there are ways to holding the agent in question accountable for their doxastic claims. Accountability here refers to the ability to reduce the epistemic trust in an authority after violating an epistemic norm (e.g. being incorrect). I argue that the algorithmic authority cannot be held accountable for its actions as it does not have capacity as an epistemic agent on its own -- it cannot be held accountable for its decisions. As the algorithm itself is a *designed object* we can instead attribute it forms of *derived* trust whereas the trust is not only in the algorithm itself, but its designer (the engineers who created the algorithm, the data engineers who sourced and cleaned the data) or experts who know how to operate it. As both types of progenitors of this type of trust are absent, it would be epistemically irrational to trust this algorithm.\n\nIn conclusion, it is clear that despite potential biases from both parties, the algorithmic authority has clear flaws in its ability to be held accountable as an epistemic agent and highly likely to be partial *against* the female candidate due to the forbidden base rate in this case study. It is much more likely that the senior hiring manager is a trustworthy epistemic agent.\n\n### References\n1.  Baier A. 1986. Trust and antitrust. *Ethics* 96:231–60.\n2. Hawley, K., 2014.

This is the point of [participatory design](thoughts/Design%20Justice.md).\n\nThe main principles of [user centered design](thoughts/human%20centered%20design.md) (Gould and Lewis) are as follows:\n1. Early focus on users and tasks: Understanding who users will be (cognitive, behavioural, anthropomorphic, and attitudinal characteristics) and observing users doing normal tasks, studying nature of normal tasks, involving users in design process.\n2. Empirical measurement: early in development, get reactions and performance of intended users to scenarios/manuals/etc. Then, later in development, get reactions and performance of users to simulations and prototypes. Where possible, specific usability and UX goals should be identified, clearly documented and agreed upon at the beginning of the project which can help designers choose between alternative designs and check on progress.\n3. Iterative design: when problems are found in user testing, they are fixed, then more tests and observations carried out to see effects of fixes. This allows the design to be refined based on feedback\n\nBenefits:\n1. Expectation management: ensuring that the users' expectations of the new product are realistic and no surprises for users when the product arrives.\n2. Ownership: users who are involved and feel that they have contributed to a product's development are more likely to feel a sense of ownerships toward it and support its user\n\nThe process of this is the [double diamond design](thoughts/design%20requirements.md).\n\n### Participation\nWide participation helps bring different perspectives to the process, which enhances design itself, produces more user satisfaction with the final product, and engenders a sense of ownership.\n\n**Participatory/cooperative/co-design** is an overarching design philosophy that places stakeholders as central actors in creation activities. A stakeholder is anybody who is affected by the item\n",

Can we have a fully crypto economy?\n\nCrypto has managed to build infrastructures that exist outside the nation state, but we still live our lives embedded in places, communities, and nations.

There’s no forcing mechanism that makes us have to learn\" -\u003e how do we keep people digitally accountable?\n\n[Dunbar](thoughts/Dunbar's%20Number.md) and his colleagues demonstrated that very light touch triggers a cascade of endorphins that, in turn, are important for creating personal relationships.

The point is developing tools that allow us to leverage computers to collaborate more effectively. It’s about accountability and choosing for ourselves what to trust. It’s about withholding trust from strangers on the internet but holding out the belief that we can build a better way.” ([Dan Finlay](https://medium.com/@danfinlay/what-moxie-missed-on-web3-wallets-8dc572e7f39b))\n\nThe cyberpunk spirit: the basic property of which adversarial conflict continues to heavily favour the defender. **It should be much more expensive to destroy or disrupt than they are to use and maintain** -- [Vitalkik Buterin](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/a-proof-of-stake-design-philosophy-506585978d51)\n\nOf course, this is not perfect technology.

Develops could generally rest assured that these protocols wouldn't change much because they were commonly agreed on by the community. \n\n### Web2, Platform Economy [2000s to 2020s]\nInternet as we know it today, companies that provide services in exchange for your personal data. Web2 enabled us to enjoy [P2P](thoughts/peer-to-peer.md) interactions on a global scale, but always with a middleman: a platform acting as a trusted intermediary between two people who do not know or trust each other.\n\nGeneral migration from open services to more sophisticated, centralized services\n\nEffects include frequent incursions on personal privacy, the spread of misinformation, and the ‘attention economy,’ all of which have fundamentally changed how we relate to one another, and destabilized civic engagement and labor across industries. [Source](https://gitcoin.co/blog/seeking-a-new-kind-of-public-good/)\n\n### Web3, Token Economy [2020s to present]\nDecentralized apps (usually running on the blockchain).\n\nMajor benefits:\n1. Anyone on the network can use the service (no one can block/deny you access to the service)\n2. Payments are built in (ether or ETH)\n3. Turing complete\n4. Require no personal data\n5. High reliability: runs on decentralized network rather than a single backend\n\nLimitations\n1. Scalability/Speed: change to state need to be processed and propagated\n2. UX: lots of information, not a lot of good ways to interface with it\n3. Fracturability: can happen when there are disagreements about [protocol](thoughts/Protocol.md) changes\n4. Cost: gas fees \n\nVerifiability is the atom of web3. It is what the hyperlink was for Web1.\n\n## Cool Applications\n### [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/)\nHow do we incentivize [open source software](posts/paid-open-source.md)? Gitcoin approaches this through decentralizing [funding](thoughts/funding.md) (away from corporations and toward individuals).\n\nNot just providing funding, 4 main value adds\n1. Earn -\u003e get paid to do maintenance work and upkeep of public goods!\n2. Learn -\u003e mentorship from industry leaders and peers\n3. Connect -\u003e creating a community of builders and support network\n4. Fund -\u003e making it easy for developers to support each other\n\n### [Golem](https://blog.golemproject.net/golem-primer/)\n\nTLDR: Golem democratizes society’s access to computing power by creating a decentralized platform where anyone can build a variety of applications, request computational resources and/or offer their idle systems in exchange for cryptocurrency tokens\n\n\u003eFrom large universities to scientists or artists, anyone can leverage the world’s unused computing power to conduct data intensive research and complex computations through the Golem Network\n\n",

To ask people to throw away their infrastructure is rather stupid.\n\t- Servers are infrastructure! Nodes are infrastructure! People won't want to run these themselves. Until we reach a point where enough web3 platforms are able to provide this same level of infrastructure, we're going to still end up with centralization.\n\t- \"If there’s one thing I hope we’ve learned about the world, it’s that people do not want to run their own servers. The companies that emerged offering to do that for you instead were successful, and the companies that iterated on new functionality based on what is possible with those networks were even more successful.\"\n- [Decentralization](thoughts/decentralization.md) is not always good. The more I get involved with the space, the more I am certain that the main value add of [blockchain](thoughts/blockchain.md) and [web3](thoughts/web3.md) is not decentralization but rather [interoperability](thoughts/interoperability.md) and [transparency](thoughts/transparency.md).\n\t- Decentralization also ends up making progress very difficult. See: [Vanilla Ice Cream effect](thoughts/Vanilla%20Ice%20Cream%20effect.md)\n\t- \"This isn’t a funding issue. If something is truly decentralized, it becomes very difficult to change, and often remains stuck in time.\"\n- Blind [trust](thoughts/trust.md). Crypto folks don't necessarily trust the people but some just blindly trust the medium. If people don't understand how the medium works to facilitate transactions, how can they trust it? Transparency also involves transparency into its inner workings.\n\t- Similarly, \"Almost all dApps use either Infura or Alchemy in order to interact with the blockchain.\"\n\t- We just rely on these two pieces of critical (centralized!) pieces of infrastructure to produce the correct results and not be bad actors.\n- [Degraded Blockchain problem](thoughts/Degraded%20Blockchain%20problem.md)\n\n### Vitalik Response\n[Source: Vitalki's Reddit Response](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ryk3it/my_first_impressions_of_web3/hrrz15r/)\n\nLevels of connecting to the blockcahin\n1.  Use a Binance account.\n2.  Run a piece of code that asks the Infura API endpoint what the blockchain state is, trust the answer. However, keys are still kept locally; the code signs transactions locally and sends them to the Infura API endpoint to be re-broadcasted.\n3.  Same as (2), but the code also runs a [light client](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/altair/sync-protocol.md) to verify the signatures on the block headers and uses Merkle proofs to verify individual account and storage data.\n4.  Same as (3), but the code talks to N different API endpoints run by N different companies, so only 1 of them need to be providing honest answers for the connection to be reliable.\n5.  Same as (4), but instead of pre-specifying N API endpoints the code connects directly to a [p2p](thoughts/peer-to-peer.md) network\n6.  Same as (5), but the code also does data availability sampling and accepts fraud proofs, so it can detect and refuse to accept blocks that are invalid.\n7.  Run a fully verifying node.\n8.  Run a fully verifying node that also participates in mining/staking.",
