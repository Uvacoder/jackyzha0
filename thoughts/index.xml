      <description>Convergence of CS and Philosophy  newell and simon claimed that both digital computers and the human mind could be understood as physical symbol systems  using strings of bits or streams of neuron pulses as symbols representing the external world (formal symbol manipulation)   intelligence (as claimed by newell and simon) required making the appropriate inference from these internal representations  &amp;ldquo;a physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means for general intelligent action&amp;rdquo;   turning rationalist philosophy into a research program  hobbes → reasoning was calculating descartes → mental representations leibniz → &amp;ldquo;universal characteristic&amp;rdquo; — a set of primitives in which all knowledge could be expresse kant → concepts are rules russell → logical atoms as the building blocks of reality    Symbolic AI as a degenerating research program  problem of representing significance and relevance → how do you transfer the learnings to the real world  Heidegger  values are just meaningless facts (hammer is for hammering), leaves out information defining the relation of hammers to nails and the rest of the environment (readiness-to-hand)   Commonsense knowledge problem → how do we represent &amp;lsquo;common sense&amp;rsquo; in a way that is accessible to AI systems that use natural language  problem isnt curating those facts, it&amp;rsquo;s knowing which facts are relevant in any given situations (the frame problem)  should be able to ignore something without having to figure out that it should ignore it   if the computer is running a representation of the current state of the world and something in the world chances, how does the program determine which of its represented facts can be assumed to have stayed the same, and which would have to be updated?</description>

      <description>GOFAI (good old-fashioned AI)  this view believes that the mind is a computer with certain special characteristics — namely the fact that its internal states and processes can be regarded as thinking or reasoning finding meaning in a body of symbols, like finding rationality in a body of behaviour, is finding a certain kind of consistent, reliable pattern problem solvers often use canny, methodical exploration  neither algorithmic nor random a familiar sort of articulate reasoning or thinking a problem out  &amp;ldquo;if only i could get that, then I could nail this down; but in order to get that, I would need such and such&amp;rdquo;     GOFAI is very narrow-minded and vulnerable to unexpected variations and oddities in the problems and information they were given grounded in the possibility of translation — semantic interpretation  NFAI (new-fangled AI)  falls under connectionism and connectionist networks  relies on computers the same way a weather service does, to simulate digitally systems that are not in themselves digital   adept at finding various sort of similarities among patterns, at recognizing repeated (or almost repeated) patterns and filling in missing parts of incomplete patterns NFAI learns from examples (but not in the same way humans do) inspired by the structure of the brain, but more deeply, by the importance and ubiquity of non-formal pattern reasoning very grab-bag term → anything that isn&amp;rsquo;t GOFAI argument that a lot of human intelligence is not embodied in anyone, its a part of the world: Extended Mind Hypothesis e.</description>

      <description>Extended view of the mind  not an internal control system, enclosed in the human body, receiving data from human sensory system and directing human action instead, as systems that extend far beyond the body of the human organism, systems that include extra-somatic resources: environmental fuels for adaptive action suggest that human cognitive systems include those resources that are importantly, robustly, reliably, or persistently supportive of decisions making  Environmentally Supported Cognition  derives from niche construction, helps to emphasize the active role of the agent in explaining the adaptive fit of agent and environment over time, agents adapt to environments but also adapt their environment to them ( Theory of Niche Construction)  &amp;ldquo;Animals construct nests, burrows and dams, thus protecting themselves from predators and from the violence of the world.</description>
