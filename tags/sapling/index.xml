      <description>Extended view of the mind  not an internal control system, enclosed in the human body, receiving data from human sensory system and directing human action instead, as systems that extend far beyond the body of the human organism, systems that include extra-somatic resources: environmental fuels for adaptive action suggest that human cognitive systems include those resources that are importantly, robustly, reliably, or persistently supportive of decisions making  Environmentally Supported Cognition  derives from niche construction, helps to emphasize the active role of the agent in explaining the adaptive fit of agent and environment over time, agents adapt to environments but also adapt their environment to them ( Theory of Niche Construction)  &amp;ldquo;Animals construct nests, burrows and dams, thus protecting themselves from predators and from the violence of the world.</description>
