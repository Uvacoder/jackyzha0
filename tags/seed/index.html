Found out about [100 Rabbits](https://100r.co/site/about_us.html), a tag-team of two people sailing around the world making open-source software\n2. OpenAIs recent work with [DALL-E](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/) and [CLIP](https://openai.com/blog/clip/). Some really revolutionary stuff in combining text and image domains.\n3. Vlogbrothers on [How To Change What you Want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salgtCpST3A). Interesting video on how content we consume steers our wants and what we want to want affects our actual wants. Hank says it in a way that makes a lot more sense so give it a watch.\n\n## 2 things I’ve been wondering about\n\n1. Why didn’t I start writing earlier? Writing has always been a way to help me organize my own thoughts. Now that I’ve started writing more frequently, I feel like I’m able to better put the jumble of thoughts inside my brain onto paper (or I guess a Markdown file in this case).\n2. Promoting healthier [hacking culture](/thoughts/hackathons). Conversation inspired by [this tweet](https://twitter.com/sarahbdhsn/status/1347666496718213120). What can we do as hackathon organizers to make events less stressful/hypercompetitive for attendees (especially those who are differently-abled)?\n\n## 1 thing I’ve done\n\nI wrote a [reflection piece about my 2020](/posts/2020) as well as set some goals for the upcoming year! A few interesting tidbits on paratelic vs telic goal setting.","lastmodified":"2022-02-15T20:23:08.833479341Z","title":"Hello world!"},"/newsletters/issue-1":{"content":"This month of January went by with blazing speed. I can't say if it's because of school starting back up or just the massive amounts of s t u f f going on in the world right now. \n\nOn an unrelated note, I'm currently working on stepping outside my comfort zone and meeting new people so feel free to email back if you'd be interested in a coffee chat! I'd be happy to learn about all the cool things y'all are working on :)\n\n## 3 things I’ve found interesting\n\n1. [Velocity vs Acceleration based execution](https://www.samsonzhang.com/2021/01/19/how-to-innovate-and-create-a-culture-of-innovation.html). Insightful read on how orgs can be [moving fast but not be innovating](thoughts/move%20fast%20and%20break%20things.md). How do we have a high acceleration org rather than just a high velocity one?\n2. [Switch Transformers: Larger than GPT-3](https://venturebeat.com/2021/01/12/google-trained-a-trillion-parameter-ai-language-model).  An interesting approach to deal with huge language models by 'sparsly' activating certain subsets of the network. Interesting to see modern ML techniques going back to expert systems of the early 90's.\n3. [Suspension of Internet in Uganda](https://blog.cloudflare.com/uganda-january-13-2021-internet-shut-down/). During an election at that. Curious how something of this scale was orchestrated, let alone agreed to. Something that feels so close to [infrastructure](/thoughts/infrastructure) shouldn't be freely shutdown so easily.\n\n## 2 things I’ve been wondering about\n\n1. How can we make policy more accessible? Idea has been festering in my head after reading Eva Zhang's post on '[Request for Startups](https://evaz.substack.com/p/rfs)'. Is there a better way we can track what policy makers are up to during non-election years? Maybe some sort of data mesh or platform that simplifies policy or makes it easier to view updates? Decided to take a stab at this problem during HTN2020++ this year. [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/legist).\n2. Digital Gardening. After reading Joel Hook's blog post on his own [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden), I've been thinking and reflecting on my own processes for managing my garden. It's culminated into a blog post which you can read [here](/posts/digital-gardening).\n\n## 1 thing I’ve done\nI presented a technical workshop for the first time at Hack the North 2020++! I've always been a little spooked of public speaking but it was really empowering to be able to go up in front of so many people (albeit virtually) and talk about something I'm passionate about. My workshop was on a gentle introduction to Docker and you can view the recording [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONNQ5EDhXUk) (it's not a Rick Roll, I promise).","lastmodified":"2022-02-15T20:23:08.833479341Z","title":"A request for coffee chats"},"/newsletters/issue-2":{"content":"I can't believe we're approaching a time of year when I can wait until *after* dinner to turn on my desk light. In the almost two months since my last newsletter, I've been doing a lot of [reading](/books), having 1:1s with some pretty rad people, [learning Rust](https://github.com/jackyzha0/rs-openai/), and of course surviving school. Surviving, in this case, is a questionable word choice.\n\n## 3 things I’ve found interesting\n\n1. [Multimodal Neurons in Neural Networks](https://openai.com/blog/multimodal-neurons/). First off, Spider-Man neuron. This paper is an interesting exploration on how neural networks can appear to have an understanding of abstract higher-level concepts that are *composable*. A lot of really interesting potential here.\n2. [Sounds of the Mandelbrot Set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiAj9WW1OfQ). Is mayonaisse an instrument? Yes, and fractals are too. A really cool look into doing an auditory visualization of things we wouldn't normally associate with sound.\n3. [Jazz Messages](https://jazzkeys.plan8.co/?msg=-MVYtMespmT9iNLyKnqO). Send notes to your friends in style with **j a z z**.\n\n## 2 things I’ve been wondering about\n\n1. What does it mean to find fulfilment in what you do? I've found myself involved with an overabundance of projects in the past year and only a select handful have truly been fulfilling to work on. I'm doing a bit of introspection in hopes of maybe figuring out why I love doing the things I love and maybe an answer to who I am.\n2. [What's not in the frame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRZuEGuU_es). In which Hank talks about the [metaphorical 'frame'](posts/context-collapse.md), or the context in which people present themselves. People choose to present themselves a certain way in front of others and in doing so, leave a lot of what's *actually* going on outside the frame. If all we ever see are other people's frames, how do we remind ourselves of what's going on outside of it and normalize being 'out-of-frame'?\n\n## 1 thing I’ve done\nPretty slow month in terms of personal projects/pieces, mostly either working on patching up older projects (finally got around to updating [Docker Explained](https://github.com/jackyzha0/docker-explained)). I did end up finishing Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software by Nadia Eghbal and found some really interesting ideas that I wanted to explore and flesh out a bit. I had a few convos with a friend on Twitter and ended up writing a piece on [why Open Source should be funded](posts/paid-open-source.md).\n\nStay tuned for next month(s) and don't forget to be awesome :)","lastmodified":"2022-02-15T20:23:08.833479341Z","title":"Spider-man neurons, hearing fractals, and fulfilment"},"/newsletters/issue-3":{"content":"Hello there and welcome back to another issue of some mildly coherent ramblings. It's been yet another couple busy weeks, but I've just wrapped up my second decade on this crazy planet!

[Context Collapse](https://www.rewire.org/context-collapse-online/). Follow up to last issue's ['What's not in the frame'](posts/context-collapse.md) question, I was finally able to put a name to a concept I've had floating around! The TLDR is the experience when all your different personalities or frames from different contexts (e.g. work, friend group, family) all intermingle. In a place where so many of your social groups intersect, it becomes difficult to decide how to behave or 'be yourself'.\n2. [Emergent Behaviour and Cellular Automata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-iSQQgOd1A). Mesmerizing video by [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/user/Cercopithecan) on [how complex (and beautiful) behaviour can arise out of simple rules.](thoughts/emergent%20behaviour.md) I've been wanting to get into experimenting with shaders and graphics stuff and this *might* just be the slight nudge I needed.\n3. [Sun Sneezing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e69XZJ9DEj0). When people ask me what I'm allergic to, my two answers are 1) pollen and 2) the sun. Yes, I sneeze when I look at the sun.\n\n## 2 things I’ve been wondering about\n\n1. [Moderation in Infrastructure](https://stratechery.com/2021/moderation-in-infrastructure/). I've been thinking a lot about [infrastructure](/thoughts/infrastructure). How do we draw the line between an end product and infrastructure? How should infrastructure regulate usage on its platform (if at all)? Been thinking about AWS's decision to remove Parler recently and whether it was warranted for AWS to do so. At what level of infrastructure should something become a '[public good](thoughts/public%20goods.md)'? As more and more of our digital infrastructure is built out under private companies, does it change how we govern content on top of it?\n2. [Are 'easy-to-use' products always better?](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/348/000/) Interesting read about the 'seductive, destructive appeal of ease of use': the belief that \"ease of use\" is somehow conflated with better products. I always hear that complex tools and apps being not implemented because user research proved that it was 'too difficult to use' but is this costing us in the long run? One great example the article talks about is the tricycle/bicycle analogy. \"It is clear that for an unskilled user, the tricycle is much easier to use. But, as we know, the payoff from investing in learning to ride on two wheels is enormous.\" Related: [building tools around workflows](thoughts/workflows.md)\n\n## 1 thing I’ve done\n\nI spent some time last weekend rewriting the frontend of [ctrl-v](http://ctrl-v.app/), my open-source Pastebin clone to use Next.js instead of React + React Router! Wrote up a blog post on my process here: [https://blog.jzhao.xyz/posts/ctrlv-next/](/posts/ctrlv-next). The weather has been nice in Vancouver the past couple of days so I've had the chance to just go outside and read in a park which has been a really nice change of pace from my usual go-go-go-get-shit-done daily schedule. Looking forward to finishing up this semester, I have a lot of really cool projects I want to work in the next month and a bit!\n\nUntil next time, don't forget to be awesome :)","lastmodified":"2022-02-15T20:23:08.833479341Z","title":"Sun sneezing, infrastructure moderation, and why bikes are better than tricycles"},"/newsletters/issue-4":{"content":"I am writing this newsletter edition as NYC is being bombarded by hail. The sounds of little balls of ice ricocheting off of the roof has a sort of din to it that feels oddly comforting? In any case, your (bi) monthly dose of links from yours truly:\n\n## 3 things I’ve found interesting\n\n1. [The bookstore with a single book.](https://www.takram.com/projects/a-single-room-with-a-single-book-morioka-shoten/) This is a tiny bookstore in Tokyo that sells a single book at a time in a small room. I really love the emphasis on getting to know a single book and author intimately -- especially in an age of [digital consumerism](thoughts/attention%20economy.md).\n2. [Beware of tight feedback loops.](https://brianlui.dog/2020/05/10/beware-of-tight-feedback-loops/) I've always believed that rapid [feedback](thoughts/feedback%20loops.md) is always necessarily good. Yet, Brian warns about relying too much on these tight feedback loops -- feedback in life is almost always noisy. Only focusing on rapid feedback can lead one to ignore the larger scale trends.\n3. [Why Algorithmic Systems Create Absurd Outcomes](https://ali-alkhatib.com/papers/chi/utopia/utopia.pdf) (or if you prefer the [video version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KLAa62h1E0). Loved how accessible this paper/video was in explaining some pretty complex topics. I've often found myself having trouble putting into words why 'big tech' and monopolies in general are bad other than the generic \"we need competition for innovation\" excuse and this humanistic approach really resonated with me.\n\n## 2 things I’ve been wondering about\n\n1. [The role of knowledge distillation.](https://distill.pub/2017/research-debt/) After finishing *The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software*, I have been seeing parallels between software maintenance and systems of knowledge. So much emphasis nowadays is on creation rather than maintenance; it would be interesting to see if we can shift the emphasis from creation of new knowledge to maintenance of existing knowledge. I think there's lots of work that can be done to improve how we go about [distillation of knowledge](thoughts/knowledge%20distillation.md) through teaching and giving children agency to explore ideas (more on this in *Mindstorms*).\n2. [The double bind of developing tech.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collingridge_dilemma) Still trying to wrap my head fully around this idea, but the main gist is that there are two opposing facts that seem to make developing tech ethically very difficult. The first is that it's hard to figure out what impact technology will make until *after* one develops and releases it to the public to use. The second is that regulating and/or changing technology is extremely difficult after the technology becomes entrenched within society. No thoughts on this yet, but just wondering if there's any way to get out of this [double-bind](thoughts/catch%2022.md) (or at least productively avoid it).\n\n## 1 thing I’ve done\nLots of change in my personal life too! I finally worked up the courage to cut out a few commitments from my life in an effort to reclaim some time to just explore some ideas I have + enjoy life in NYC :') Reach out if you're around!","lastmodified":"2022-02-15T20:23:08.833479341Z","title":"The bookstore with a single book, knowledge distillation, and tight feedback loops"},"/posts/2020":{"content":"## A year of 'almosts'\n2020 is:\n* about 9.5 times longer than a Rick Roll in seconds\n* about 54 times longer than the number of minutes I listened to Spotify this year\n* about how many contributions I made on GitHub this year\n* roughly the amount of pages I've read this year\n* almost a palindrome\n\nNow there's nothing super fascinating about almost-palindromes but it is also very fitting given the number of 'almosts' in my year. Here's an imperfect recollection of what I've been up to this year.\n\n### nwPlus\nI help to do event logistics at nwPlus! This year, Allison and Anne somehow convinced me to take on a director role for HackCamp (or what was previously known as UBC Local Hack Day). \n\nTo be completely frank, I had no clue what that really entailed and jumped into it head-first. Along the way, I struggled with figuring out how to effectively lead a team of 4 older teammates, balancing nwPlus with all my other commitments, and being confident in my work as director. We had a bunch of logistical wrenches thrown our way, from figuring out how to bring our hackathon to the virtual stage to and navigating an entire event rebrand. It was honestly amazing to have even been able to hold the event at all, let alone attract over 900+ registrations, 500+ attendees, 3.2k+ livestream viewers, and $1200 in donations to charities. To say I was completely blown away by the turnout would be a massive understatement. We didn't get to hold the in-person event we were hoping for, but the next-best thing was almost just as good.\n\n![Post-HackCamp feels](/posts/images/2020/post-hc.png)*Post-HackCamp Feels*\n\n### A poorly played game of Tetris\nDue to a combination of poor planning, luck, and FOMO, I made the poor decision to take on an internship at Hootsuite along with the open-source fellowship at MLH, all the while trying to juggle my mental sanity and health. Spoiler alert: it was a bad idea.\n\nMy calendar ended up looking a lot like a poorly played game of Tetris as I tried to stack hackathon onto after-work social onto tech talk. Unfortunately in this version of Tetris, there was no line clearing when I fully packed a week. You don't need more than two braincells to realize that a schedule like that just isn't sustainable. I was often working upwards of 80+ hours a week and I felt like death reincarnate. I think the lowest point of the summer was sitting on the couch after working an 8 hour day at Hootsuite followed by another 6 hours on fellowship things and realizing that I only had oatmeal in the morning. \"I should learn to play the ukelele.\"\n\nIn order to get through the summer, I had to develop healthier coping methods to deal with the stress, anxiety, and general lack-of-time-to-do-anything that came along with it. Though I by no means have claimed to have solved any of these things, I've found a few things to be really helpful in maintaining some semblance of mental sanity:\n\n1. **Time Blocking** -- COVID had eliminated any physical boundaries I already had; no 15 minute transit to separate work and home, no physical walk required to go from home to school. As a result, everything started to meld together. If it only takes me 3 clicks to go from my club meeting to my work tickets, I can just work just a little longer, right? I found that time blocking really let me regain a little bit of control back in my life. I could tell myself to only spend *x* hours doing *y*. It had the added benefit of allowing me to *actually block off time for myself* and to enjoy life a little bit.\n2. **Exercise** -- although I've known this fact for a while now, this is the year I've really decided to actually apply it to my life. Feeling like garbage? Go for a run to feel more like garbage for a good hour before feeling better! I've had the privilege of being really close to nature so I get to enjoy the subtle crunching of leaves and brisk autumn air with each step.\n3. **Quality time with quality people** -- 2020 was not a kind year to most, myself included and I'm not going to pretend otherwise. However, the presence of a select few individuals in my life really helped to make the year slightly less of a dumpster fire. You know who you are :')\n\n### Independent living\nI finally moved out from on-campus housing into my own place! I've definitely felt tinges of loneliness during the pandemic but I've learned to fill the silence with music, podcasts, reading, or questionable arts and crafts. I've also somehow managed to get by the past few months without giving myself food poisoning in my transition from campus food to homecooked food.\n\nNo fancy photos here but enjoy a few pictures of my workspace and the view from my balcony.\n\n![Home sweet 127.0.0.1](/posts/images/2020/home.png)*Home sweet 127.0.0.1*\n\n## An imperfect retrospective\nIt would be sort of naive to try to list out everything that went well/didn't go well this year. Too much happened this year to fully give each bit of my year the respect it deserves, so in the spirit of this 'almost' year, enjoy this 'almost' retrospective.\n\n### Things that sparked joy\n- **Surrounding myself with genuine people who care.**\n- **Picking up old hobbies and books** -- Heraclitus said, \"No man steps in the same river twice.\" The second time around, both man and river are different than they were before. The paints and books are the same, but we change between reads and brushstrokes. The world changes, too. I've found it really rewarding to be able to pick up old hobbies like watercolour, crocheting, and [reading](/thoughts/reading) and discover it for the second time.\n- **Exercising more and enjoying nature** -- not everyday you get to read during sunset at the top of a peak with some of your closest friends.\n### Things that didn't spark to joy\n- **Learning to block out time better** -- although I did improve on this, I've definitely told myself \"ah, another few hours couldn't hurt\" far too many times this year. I need to work on prioritizing my time more and saying no to things.\n- **Balancing intake and output** -- How does one balance learning/intake of information intake with processing and thinking about that information? This year felt like trying to drink information through a firehose and spitting it right back out using a paper straw. I'm trying to work on better processes for choosing what information to explore more and to spend more time thinking and marinating thoughts (see: [exploit explore](thoughts/exploit%20explore.md) tradeoff). [Tweet.](https://twitter.com/_jzhao/status/1328399991950307328)\n\n## Goal setting\nWhen writing up the first few drafts for this post, I realized that just having goals with cold hard numbers on them without any motivating reason feels very empty. I'm not setting these goals just to achieve some number, but rather to enjoy the act of doing it or to develop a habit. I had a conversation with [Emre](https://twitter.com/AlcaEmre) about this and he brought up Reversal Theory as a way to understand our motivations and goals. In particular, one of the four domains of Reversal Theory is the means-ends domain. Motivations in this domain lie somewhere on the telic to paratelic action scale.\n\n**Telic Actions** are more serious in nature, motivated by wanting to achieve something or reach a goal. This would be like writing an essay to get a good mark. Most telic actions are a means to an end rather than the actual end themselves.\n\n**Paratelic Actions** are more [playful](thoughts/play.md) in nature and involve enjoying the process in the moment. This is more akin to reading for enjoyment and for the pleasure of learning. Hopefully, these are the actual end goals that telic actions will help achieve. With that in mind, here are my 2021 goals!\n### Paratelic Goals\n- Acknowledging my privilege and use it to help those who are less fortunate\n- Have impact with my work, whether that be through writing, projects, or just conversations\n- Lead a more physically healthy lifestyle\n- Learn more about the world through a [feedback loops](thoughts/feedback%20loops.md) of reading, writing, and talking to people\n\n### Telic Goals\n- Donate 5% of pre-tax income to charity\n- Reach 50k people through projects and blog posts\n- Read 10 books\n- Set aside 10 hours a week for personal projects, learning, and writing\n- Be able to run from my apartment to Stanley Park and back (~10km) in one go\n- Have 1:1s with 50 new people in 2021\n\nI've been waiting almost 2 years to say this pun but,\n\n\u003e hindsight is 2020.\n\n(no I didn't plan on releasing this right at midnight, I just take a long time to write)","lastmodified":"2022-02-15T20:23:08.833479341Z","title":"2020: An Imperfect Palindrome"},"/posts/2021":{"content":"---\n\n\u003e Have you been writing those letters to yourself?\n\u003e \"Dear Evan Hansen, This is gonna be a good day and here’s why.\"\n\nThis post comes to you in 3 parts: a letter to my past self, a reflection on goals, and a letter to my future self.\n\nOne reminiscent and nostalgic, one a neutral review, and the last a brutally honest dump of aspirations and feelings.","lastmodified":"2022-02-15T20:23:08.833479341Z","title":"A Letter to my Past and Future selves"},"/posts/Me-my-selves-and-I":{"content":"---\n\n*An exploration on commitment, [trust](thoughts/trust.md), and growth.*\n\n![The Persistence of Memory by Salvador Dalí](/thoughts/images/the%20persistence%20of%20memory.png)*The Persistence of Memory by Salvador Dalí*","lastmodified":"2022-02-15T20:23:08.833479341Z","title":"Me, my selves, and I"},"/posts/a-failure-resume":{"content":"Imposter Syndrome has been hitting really hard lately. Sometimes, it makes me feel like I don't deserve a lot of my current accomplishments and that I need to work even harder just to feel like I deserve what I have right now. I came across the concept of a **failure resume**[^1] a while ago. It's a list of things that didn't exactly go according to plan, and the lessons learned.\n\nThe more I think about it, the more I realize that a failure resume is a great way to document all the spectacular ways you've worked hard towards your own goals and accomplishments. In some ways, it validates your struggle and your effort.\n\nI've recently been inspired by both Kate Huang[^2] and Joice Tang's[^3] failure resumes and decided to make my own. What I wanted to try with this failure resume is, rather than focusing on the individual failures themselves, note what I learned from each of them. Hopefully, it'll serve as a powerful reminder to myself of how much I've struggled to get to where I am and why I deserve to be here. And more importantly, it serves as a place to reflect and learn from the past and be less scared of failure in the future.\n\n*A 2021 update:* Keeping a failure resume has let me be so much more ambitious in trying new things and applying for things I would otherwise think I'm unqualified to apply for! I'm really glad I started this.\n\nNow with all that stuff out of the way, here's the juicy list you've been waiting for:\n\n## 2021\n\n* Stopped sending out newsletter issues :(( Ended up focusing more on longer form writing instead\n\n* Ghosted by both Contrary Build and Contrary Fellowship\n\n* Couldn't work up the courage to apply to the [Maintainers Summer Fellowship](https://themaintainers.org/summer-fellow)\n\t* I really love the work that the Maintainers org is doing and this internship would have combined so many things that I'm interested in and passionate about: maintenance, writing, software, infrastructure, etc. I just couldn't convince myself that I wouldn't have made a fool of myself by applying :(\n\n* Had to cut out a bunch of commitments in order to maintain mental sanity\n  * While this isn't a 'failure' in the traditional sense, it was a failure for me in terms of setting good boundaries for myself. I had been spending way too much of my 'free' time working for projects and commitments I wasn't 100% interested in. I missed being able to just dedicate an afternoon to tinkering and exploring an idea so I decided to make the leap and cut down on commitments. **If it's not a hell yes, it's a no.**\n\n* Rejected from the Delta Fellowship\n\n* Rejected from ZFellows after they reached out to 'learn more' about my idea\n  \n* Rejected from the Y. P. Heung Foundation Award\n  * This scholarship is awarded to someone who demonstrates outstanding academic performance and is involved with community activities. I thought that, despite my slightly-above-average grades, I had a decent shot at this award given my involvement with the CS community at UBC but things didn't turn out the way I wanted. This award would've helped alleviate the financial stress that comes with having to pay tuition out-of-pocket, so I'll need to work a bit more for that money.\n\n## 2020\n\n* Rejected from an undergraduate TA position for a CS course\n  * I really wanted to give TA-ing a shot, especially after hearing almost all friends' positive experiences with it, so I decided to apply to TA a class I had done well in. It was a good reality check to realize that there's more to being a TA than just good grades and the title. Next time I apply, I'll find a course that I'm really passionate about and get to know the prof better.\n\n* Didn't finish 3 of the projects I wanted to finish over the summer\n  * I think I really just tried to commit to too many things this summer and spread myself really thin \u0026mdash; I'm still working on learning how to say no!\n\n* Ghosted by a professor for an undergrad research position\n\n* Rejected from a lot of grants and incubator programs for reflect\n  * We took the shotgun approach by applying to as many grants as possible but ended up realizing that were just applying to grants for the sake of applying, rather than having a good reason for why. It was a really good catalyst to reflect (pun intended) on what we wanted reflect to be and what direction to take it in the future.\n\n* Rejected by DeepMind (and 67 of the 70 companies I applied to)\n  * This position rejection hurt more than most \u0026mdash; even if it was swift and abrupt. DeepMind is a company that has played a huge part in shaping my interest of the intersection of machine learning, ethics, and philosophy, so you can imagine that the rejection email was not a pleasant sight to see in my inbox.\n\n## 2019\n\n* Rejected by 46 of the 47 companies I applied to\n\n* Practiced data structures/algorithms for a few months only to completely blank on final round phone interviews\n  * Though I agree that the technical interview process is broken, I think there are still some lessons that can be learned. I suck at thinking under pressure so I'm going to learn to improve this by trying to keep my practice environment as similar to the real thing as possible. In this case, doing mock interviews with friends rather than just blindly grinding away at LeetCode.\n\n* Got a 52% on an honours math midterm\n  * It was an extremely difficult course but it really changed how I think about math and problem solving overall. I doubt I would've been able to learn those lessons in a regular math course. Even if the actual marks I got in the course were subpar at best, I think the lessons I learned were worth more than the GPA dent.\n\n* Rejected by Hack the North (despite being on their website ???)\n  * Sometimes even when all the cards seem to be in your favour, things just don't work out. There's a factor of luck in everything \u0026mdash; dont take things for granted!\n\n* Got charged an excess of $350CAD in cloud computing costs because of bad architectural decisions\n  * Ouch, this one really hurt the wallet. Learn to estimate costs in advance, and don't overengineer if you don't need to! Keep it to the simplest and most minimal viable product possible until you're ready to scale it. If it doesn't need huge infrastructure, don't design it that way!\n\n## 2018\n\n* Rejected by 16 of the 17 universities I applied to\n  * This was a good reality check \u0026mdash; the real world is difficult. Sometimes, what you offer may not be what the universities are looking for and thats ok! I think what matters more is what you do, not where you do it.\n\n* Rejected from a bunch of scholarships\n\n* Applied to speak at TEDxRedmond but got rejected at the last round\n  * I ended up learning a lot about my topic (ethics in AI and machine learning) through preparing for my speech. Even if I never got the chance to actually go up on stage and see it, the subject still ocassionally comes up in conversation and makes a great talking point! I think its super important to be educated on this, especially as our world becomes increasingly dominated by AI and machine learning.\n\n* Gave up on my DroneNet project after running out of money to work on it and little to no progress for multiple months\n  * This was my first **real** long term project and probably the project that got me really invested in the field of CS. I learned a lot about how to scope out and plan larger scale projects and how to stay motivated for long stretches of time.\n\n[^1]: [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/smarter-living/failure-resume.html)\n[^2]: [Kat Huang's](https://www.katmh.com/fail/)\n[^3]: [Joice Tang's](https://www.notion.so/failure-resume-5e67efb72dfe4f4896bc812ed94dc098)","lastmodified":"2022-02-15T20:23:08.833479341Z","title":"A Failure Resume"},"/posts/ai-systems":{"content":"---\n\nThis blog post is adapted from a term paper I wrote for PHIL250: Minds and Machines at UBC.

Its approach to weaving together insights from a vast number of disciplines to create something novel is extremely refreshing. I just read a section on learning, the knowledge illusion, and collaborative thinking and wanted to share some of my thoughts that have been bouncing around and marinating for a few days as well as some learnings that I've applied to my own life.\n\n## Collaborative Thinking\n\u003e Humans rarely think for themselves. Rather, we think in groups. Just as it takes a tribe to raise a child, it also takes a tribe to invent a tool, solve a conflict, or cure a disease. No individual knows everything it takes to build a cathedral, an atom bomb, or an aircraft. \n\nIt is no secret that the key to the rise of *Homo Sapiens* and the anthropocene wasn't due to the rationality of any individual human, but rather our collective unparalleled ability to think and share knowledge in large groups. This concept has arisen in the form of *specialization of labour*.\n\nAs a society, we consistently rely on the knowledge of others to live our own comfortable lives. I may not know how to grow my very own russet potatoes, but a farmer in Alberta might. Similarly, a plumber in Massachusetts may not know how to build their own website, but I might. Through being able to supplement each other's knowledge of the world, our *collective* knowledge is much greater.\n\n![Left: Collective knowledge of the group. Right: My subset of knowledge](/posts/images/collaborative-thinking/knowledge.png)*Left: Collective knowledge of the group. Right: My subset of knowledge*\n\nI like to think about collective knowledge as a big blob. Each individual contributes a unique *subset* of knowledge. We get the entirety of human knowledge by taking the *union of the knowledge* of all the individuals in the group. Of course, as these groups of individuals grow ever larger due to globalization, each individual may choose to specialize in a narrower subset of knowledge as generations go on to reduce redundancy. Why know how to build your own car when you can buy it yourself? The adoption of globally accepted currencies has made this easier than ever.\n\n## Knowledge illusion\nHumans also have this 'knowledge illusion' where we think we know a lot, even though individually we know very little. We treat the knowledge of the human collective as if it were our own, even subconsciously.\n\n![A crude illustration of a jacket zipper](/posts/images/collaborative-thinking/zipper.png)*A crude illustration of a jacket zipper*\n\nAn example Harari used was the sweater zipper. If I were to ask you if you knew how a zipper works, the vast majority of you would exclaim \"yes, of course!\" Yet, if asked to describe in *detail* every single step, most would fail to do so. Even with something that seems so basic and intuitive seems to elude an explicit explanation. We have begun to stand on the shoulders of giants yet refuse to acknowledge their presence.\n\nAlthough we may have increased the overall area of our collective knowledge, the surface area of each individual has also shrunken, turning from balanced and broad to narrow and unwieldy.\n\n## Rebalancing our blob of knowledge\nAnother interesting property about the knowledge blobs of individuals is that they are *magnetic*. I mean this in the sense that individuals that have one blob of knowledge tend to attract and be attracted to individuals with similar orientations and shapes in their blobs of knowledge, much like how magnetic dipoles align in a magnet. As humans, we tend to want to minimize our cognitive dissonance and surrounding ourselves with like-minded individuals is the easiest way to do that.\n\nIndividuals in these clusters experience a sort of echo chamber effect whereby the *magnitude* of their knowledge is amplified through the mutual alignment of their knowledge. However, this also poses a unique challenge where movement only happens in one direction and there is little to no room to deviate from that direction and try something new; something incredibly dangerous for innovation. This, in a sense, is turning collaborative thinking into groupthink.\n\n\u003e People afraid of losing their truth tend to be more violent than people who are used to looking at the world from several different viewpoints.\n\n![Broadening our base fundamental knowledge. Blue: Previous 'specialized' knowledge. Purple: broad foundational knowledge](/posts/images/collaborative-thinking/spikes.png)*Blue: Previous 'specialized' knowledge. Purple: broad foundational knowledge*\n\nWhat we can do to counteract this extreme alignment is to build a broader foundation of knowledge. When you come across an individual with differing views, hopefully you will at least have the base fundamental knowledge to understand their perspective.\n\n## Learning communities\nThis, at least in part, is why I've recently become more certain of wanting to go to [academia](/thoughts/academia) in the future. I used to have tunnel-vision in thinking that all I wanted to do in the future was to just work in industry CS. Recently, I've started to realize that CS not a single discipline, but rather it's a tool that can help solve uniquely human problems, and these human problems are inherently multidisciplinary.\n\nI've started to read and learn more about the world around me outside of my little bubble of CS-related topics and it's been eye-opening to see issues I read about in my philosophy class come up in a linguistics lecture which in turn comes up in a book I'm reading. I've found that the best way for me to cement my learning and understanding is through discussion with people, rather than just sitting and ruminating on my own -- a very different pace than the typical *code-Stackoverflow-copy-repeat* self-learning cycle that most programmers (including myself) are familiar with.\n\nThe important part of learning communities like colleges is not necessarily the alignment in what you're studying, but rather in the shared mindset of discussion, learning, and understanding. To broaden my foundation of knowledge is to read more about the opinions and findings of others and to critically discuss these among peers who may have different views. If we want our specialized knowledge to be applicable in a wide range of situations, we need a broad foundational base that can support that.\n\n## Wiggle room\n\u003e If you want to go deeply into any subject, you need a lot of time, and in particular, you need the privilege of wasting time. You need to experiment with unproductive paths, explore dead ends, make space for doubts and boredom, and allow little seeds of insight to slowly grow and blossom\n\nFor me, learning is very close to a [zero sum](thoughts/zero%20sum.md) game. I can only expand the area of my knowledge blob so fast. If I want to broaden my foundational knowledge base, I need to reign in the amount of time spent growing purely technical strengths and to stop saying 'yes' to any and every opportunity that comes up.\n\nSlowly but surely, I'm learning to value my own time and to set it aside to just absorb more about the world and to extend the reaches of my knowledge just a little bit further. To dilly-dally among the Wikipedia rabbit holes, cultivate [my digital garden](/posts/digital-gardening), and faff among the ridiculously long list of side projects I planned to start. I'm experimenting with what I previously thought were deadends and little seeds of insight are starting to grow. Maybe I'll find something interesting to share among the construction of this broader foundation.\n\n**Acknowledgements**\n\nA big thank yu to [Anson](https://twitter.com/ansonyuu) for always being a sounding board for fresh dough (half-baked ideas would be too generous of a description for these).

I also wouldn't post LinkedIn-style business content to my Facebook timeline. To an extent, my social presence across these platforms is *incongruent*. The core tenet is that different apps curate different types of communities and thus social contexts. As a result, we try to separate these contexts in the best way we know how to: by acting differently, **and that's ok.** \n\nIt is not 'inconsistent' for us to want to frame ourselves differently on Twitter than on Facebook, and in fact, a lot of key aspects of human behaviour point to why we default to doing so.\n\nThe problem comes when these spaces start bleeding into each other, and the boundaries between the different audiences on each of them start amalgamating. The *overlap* in target audience between these spaces then becomes very large and all of these different social contexts ['collapse'](https://www.rewire.org/context-collapse-online/) and it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain these separate personalities.\n\n## What's (not) in the frame\nIn this [vlogbrothers video from March](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRZuEGuU_es), John Green talks about the metaphorical frame in which people present themselves. We tailor and adjust our behaviour depending on the environment we're in, or the audience we find ourselves in front of. However, in doing so, we inadvertently portray an incomplete picture – we frame only the parts we want them to see.\n\n\u003e \"I mean of course the central trick of the social internet, is that whenever you make something, you choose what's inside the frame, but as viewers the rest of us can't help but believe what's inside the frame, because it's literally all we can see\"\n\nAn unfortunate side effect of this is that it starts setting expectations for the audience as to how we 'normally' behave. This 'audience' of people can be friends, followers, or strangers. They are a group of people that pay attention to what *you* have to say because of your thoughts, opinions, and general persona. So what happens when we change?\n\nIf we're expected to keep growing as people, these thoughts and opinions will obviously change over time. So why does it feel so *weird*, for both the audience and ourselves, to deviate from these set identities that we've become used to portraying in certain scenarios?\n\n## Context separation\n![Abstract illustration of a blob framed by two picture frames](/posts/images/framing/context-separation.png)\n\nIn order to answer that question, let us make a brief foray into the realm of psychology. Why do humans tend to act differently in different environments? I think three key aspects of behaviour play a role here:\n\n### People are unique\nNo one individual has the exact same interests, goals, values, and identity as you. We have different friends and environments, so we create different contexts in which we can exercise different aspects of ourselves. People find spaces where they can authentically express all the dimensions of themselves. If a situation only exercises one axis of our self-identity, we will actively seek out places to exercise other axes.\n\n### Behaviour is sticky\nIt is easier to travel along a path well-travelled than one covered in weeds and bush -- if you do something once, it becomes easier to do it again. Similarly, doing something with a certain context once means it becomes easier to repeat that same behaviour in that context again. If I use Twitter as my social media of choice to post memes, I'm likely to continue using it like so.\n\nIn some ways, this is Newton's First Law but applied to behaviour: if you do something one way, you are likely to keep doing things in that way unless encouraged to do otherwise.\n\n### Individuals tend to conform to [group norms](thoughts/social%20contracts.md)\nIn 1951, Solomon Asch conducted [an experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments) to investigate the extent of which social pressures can affect a person's behaviour. In this experiment, he asked, \"Which line is the longest out of the three given?\". In an individual setting, 99% of people answered correctly. However, when put in a room of actors instructed to answer incorrectly, nearly 75% of all participants gave at least one incorrect answer throughout 12 trials.\n\nPeople conform for two main reasons:\n1. They want to fit in with the [group](/thoughts/communities) **(normative influence)**\n2. They believe the group is better informed than they are **(informational influence)**\n\nHistorically, having different behaviours in different contexts may have been evolutionarily beneficial, helping us to better collaborate and form connections with each other without causing undue conflict.\n\nEven as children, when we get hurt, we look to authority figures around us to see how to react. If our mother comes to us expressing worry and concern, we cry. If everyone around us continues to play as if everything is normal, we will brush aside the injury and continue to play with the group.\n\nOur ability to 'frame' ourselves different depending on the social situation likely stemmed from this behaviour too.\n\n\n## Why context collapse is bad\n![Abstract illustration of a blob framed by two picture frames](/posts/images/framing/context-collapse.png)\n\nWhen experiencing context collapse, talking to your audience beyond a surface level becomes very difficult. Smaller groups, by nature, have more commonalities to relate to, whether that be interests, music taste, place of study, or lived experiences. These groups provide the chance for individuals to have intimate conversations and exercise different facets of themselves that they otherwise wouldn't get the chance to. A queer person may be out to a close group of friends but not to their family; a budding writer can have a safe place to explore potential ideas without alienating the rest of their friend group.\n\nWhen we experience context collapse, these social groups and audiences become massive, and the amount of overlap in interests or values of the collective group is miniscule. How are you supposed to have any sort of meaningful connection when the only thing you share in common on the platform is that you ‘know’ each other?\n\n## Centrifuging contexts\nI’ve noticed three main strategies individuals, companies, and platforms have adopted in trying to tackle context collapse.\n\n1. **Lowest Common Denominator** ([Vanilla Ice Cream effect](thoughts/Vanilla%20Ice%20Cream%20effect.md)). Only making posts that anybody will be able to understand and relate to, staying away from controversial or overly personal topics. This approach places an emphasis on quantity of impressions over quality of impressions.\n\n2. **Realtime**. Platforms and individuals are leaning more towards [ephemereal content](thoughts/ephemereal%20content.md), like stories or streaming. The 'live' aspect of it means that the audience is encouraged to interact immediately, creating a tighter feedback loop with the audience.\n\n3. **Fragmentation**. Purposefully having conversations in places where your audience is smaller, like group chats, direct messages, or small closed communities. In these cases, the specific context and audience is well-defined. More users are also turning to 'finstas' which are accounts focused for a closed group of friends and family rather than the entire public internet.\n\nI don’t think there is a single 'right' approach, and in part that's why so many types of social networks exist today: they each have their own merits that incentive different approaches to communication. But one part I do want to emphasize is the tradeoff of depth and breadth in these approaches.\n\n## Social bandwidth\nI think in part, this is why nobody has been successful in creating a single social network to replace all of the existing apps. As humans, we want the ability to closely connect with people, and context collapses makes that exceedingly difficult. We have limited social [bandwidth](thoughts/bandwidth.md) -- there's only so much attention we can give to everyone. By increasing the breadth of our audience, we reduce the depth at which we can communicate with each individual. As app developers rush to combine all of these platforms into one, maybe we should step back and think whether this is really necessary.\n\nOn these larger social media apps where I'm 'connected' to hundreds of people, I don't feel like I can have very insightful conversations or thoughts. Those conversations almost exclusively happen in communities like [nwPlus](http://nwplus.io/) and [Reboot](https://twitter.com/reboot_hq/) where there is enough alignment of values and interests that we can scrape past the surface level chit chat and get to really exploring ideas and knowing people.\n\nBecause we're so actively a part of all of these different contexts, we are forced to be excessively general on these platforms to try to cater to everyone. We should have platforms where it's ok to engage with different elements of who you are. We have different groups of friends to cater to different aspects of who we are, so why should social media platforms be any different?\n\nDifferent social contexts call for different social behaviours, and that's ok.\n\n*Special thanks to Anson, Ivan, Rishi, Joss, Jasmine, Kat, and Anh for helping read over and edit this piece!

I wanted to see what all the fuss was about, so I finally set aside some time this weekend to rewrite the frontend using Next.js and deployed it on Vercel instead of Firebase Hosting. I thought it would take the whole weekend, but I managed to go from zero knowledge about Next.js to a fully finished refactor in just under 6 hours!\n\nThis will be more of a technical blog post walking through my process in converting ctrl-v from using React Router and Firebase Hosting to Next.js and Firebase.\n\nSource code: https://github.com/jackyzha0/ctrl-v\n\n## Learning Next.js\nI'm a very hands-on learner. I learn the fastest stumbling my way through a project with a framework I barely know my way around than watching multiple video examples or reading blog posts. Having a tangible project to work with and break as I learned things really helped speed up the learning process for me. That being said, here are a few other resources I found really helpful in my journey!  \n\n* [Next.js in 100 seconds + good beginner tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sklc_fQBmcs)\n* [Twiddling around with `create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app)\n* [Next.js official documentation for migrating from React Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/migrating/from-react-router)\n\n## Why Next.js\nThe main reason I wanted to switch to Next.js is because it makes it dead easy to implement both Static Site Generation (SSG) and Server Side Rendering (SSR) for your React app. For those uninitiated, SSR and SSG are different approaches to rendering content.\n\nIn **Client Side Rendering (CSR)**, the client is responsible for rendering the content on the page. All they receive is an empty HTML document, and a bunch of JavaScript bundles through which the browser populates the page. The downside of this approach is that no content exists on the page when it is first loaded. As a result, web crawlers won't be able to find your content (not great for SEO), and you won't get link previews to your content as the page metadata won't have loaded. This is the behaviour you get when you use plain old React.\n\nIn **Server Side Rendering (SSR)**, the server is responsible for rendering the content of the page and sending the fully rendered the content to the user to display. In this approach, all the content is already loaded when the user is receives it, we only need JavaScript to make it interactable (i.e. hydrate it). As a result, this approach is a lot more SEO friendly.\n\nOn the very other end of the spectrum, **Static Site Generation (SSG)**, means that the server does all of the page rendering at *build time* rather than on each request. This has all the same benefits as SSR but doesn't really make a lot of sense for this project as I don't have a full list of pages I need to render handy.\n\n**A hybrid approach**\n\nHowever, Next.js doesn't force you to choose between the two. It actually prides itself in just how easy they make it to switch between them. Here's the approach I decided to take for ctrl-v. \n\nIn the old frontend, everything was completely client-side rendered. My 'productionized' application was quite literally an `index.html` with a bunch of JS bundles. It sucked as whenever I sent a ctrl-v link to a friend, there wouldn't be a preview about what the content was and most people were scared to just open a random link like that (rightfully so). There was also a not-very-pleasant 'loading paste...' period before any content actually appeared on the screen.\n\n![Old vs new approaches to rendering content](/posts/images/ctrlv-next/rendering.png)\n\nI realized that there were only really two main types of pages\n1. View Paste (`/:paste`)\n2. Create Paste (`/`)\n\nNothing on the create paste page actually required hitting the backend, it was effectively completely static. I could safely just replace that entire page and have it be statically generated at build time. The view paste page required me to make a call to ctrl-v's backend API but I still wanted the page to have that content rendered on server so I opted for client side rendering on any view paste pages.\n\n## Steps\n### Replacing React Router with `next/router`\nNext.js uses a file-based routing system rather than routes-as-code approach that React Router takes. I decided to first convert the new paste page as that would be completely SSG. Luckily, I had originally structured my React components into a `pages` folder so pulling out that component into a page wasn't terrible.\n\nI wasn't super certain of how SSR worked right off the bat so I first played with the `/raw/:paste` page first before tackling the comparatively more scary `/:paste` page with password handling and actual error handling. \n\n```jsx\n// old CSR\nconst Raw = ({hash}) =\u003e {\n   const { err, result } = useFetchPaste(hash)\n   return \u003cRawText\u003e{result?.content || err}\u003c/RawText\u003e\n}\n\nexport default Raw\n\n// new SSR\nexport async function getServerSideProps(ctx) {\n  // ctx.params.hash allows us to access the slug (the :paste part of the url)\n  const data = await resolvePaste(ctx.params.hash)\n  return { props: { ...data } }\n}\n\nconst Raw = ({error, data}) =\u003e {\n  return \u003cdiv\u003e\n    {/* Only load title/description metadata if no error */}\n    {!error \u0026\u0026 \u003cNextHead data={data} /\u003e}\n    \u003cRawText\u003e\n      {/* Just render the content if it exists, otherwise render the errror */}\n      {data?.content || error}\n    \u003c/RawText\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n}\n\nexport default Raw\n```\n\nThe biggest part I needed to wrap my head around was the `getServerSideProps` async function. I didn't realize that the only job that `getServerSideProps` actually does, is fetch data and pass that data as props to your actual component. Once that clicked, the rest of the refactoring went relatively smoothly.\n\nI had to refactor my `useFetchPaste` hook to just fetch data and then delegated the responsibility of state and password validation shenanigans to whatever component. I ended up changing the name to `resolvePaste` as it no longer followed the [Rules of Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html).\n\nIn hindsight, I probably should've done this step incrementally using something like [Next.js's rewrite rules](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/rewrites) to gradually transition ctrl-v from React Router to Next.js. Luckily I didn't have that many pages to migrate but this is good to know for the future.\n\n### `styled-components` and theme provider\nFrom what I've seen, Next.js doesn't play nicely with `styled-components` out of the box. Throughout the entire previous step, I was looking at painfully broken CSS. Turns out you need to [install an additional Babel plugin](https://styled-components.com/docs/tooling#babel-plugin) to add SSR support to `styled-components`. Then, I added a custom `Document` to `pages/_document.js`. This code augments the root `\u003chtml\u003e` tag of our application which will allow us to inline our CSS styles. \n\n```jsx\n// shamelessly stolen from\n// https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/master/examples/with-styled-components/pages/_document.js\nimport Document from 'next/document'\nimport { ServerStyleSheet } from 'styled-components'\n\nexport default class StyledDocument extends Document {\n  static async getInitialProps(ctx) {\n    const sheet = new ServerStyleSheet()\n    const originalRenderPage = ctx.renderPage\n\n    try {\n      ctx.renderPage = () =\u003e\n        originalRenderPage({\n          enhanceApp: (App) =\u003e (props) =\u003e\n            sheet.collectStyles(\u003cApp {...props} /\u003e),\n        })\n\n      const initialProps = await Document.getInitialProps(ctx)\n      return {\n        ...initialProps,\n        styles: (\n          \u003cdiv\u003e\n            {initialProps.styles}\n            {sheet.getStyleElement()}\n          \u003c/div\u003e\n        ),\n      }\n    } finally {\n      sheet.seal()\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAs I was also using theme provider from `styled-components`, I needed a way to wrap the ThemeProvider component around everything. Luckily a custom `App` created by adding a `pages/_app.js` will allow us to do just that. This also allows us to add any 'global' structure like padding or margins around the edges.\n\n```jsx\nimport ThemeProvider from \"../theme/ThemeProvider\";\nimport GlobalStyle from \"../theme/GlobalStyle\";\n\nconst Main = styled.div`\n  margin-top: 10vh;\n  padding: 0 20vw 30px 20vw;\n`\n\nconst App = ({ Component, pageProps }) =\u003e (\n  \u003cThemeProvider\u003e\n    \u003cGlobalStyle /\u003e\n    \u003cHead\u003e\n      \u003ctitle\u003ectrl-v | a modern, open-source pastebin\u003c/title\u003e\n    \u003c/Head\u003e\n    \u003cMain id=\"appElement\"\u003e\n      \u003cComponent {...pageProps} /\u003e\n    \u003c/Main\u003e\n  \u003c/ThemeProvider\u003e\n)\n\nexport default App\n```\n\n\n### State caching for password pastes\nThis part stumped me for a good bit. I needed to find a way to do an initial data fetch, check to see if the paste has a password, prompt the user for a password, then reload the page data. I contemplated using [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) for data fetching but realized in the shower that it wouldn't really make sense as the initial load is handled in the `getServerSideProps` function anyways. I realized the best way forward was to fetch the initial state in `getServerSideProps` then store it as a React State so I can update it when a password is entered and data is re-fetched. This way there are no page reloads to disrupt user experience and keeps code change minimal. \n\n```jsx\n// simplified version of pages/[hash].js\nexport async function getServerSideProps(ctx) {\n  const data = await resolvePaste(ctx.params.hash)\n  return { props: { ...data } }\n}\n\nconst ViewPaste = ({data, unauthorized, error}) =\u003e {\n  const router = useRouter()\n  const { hash } = router.query // equivalent to ctx.params.hash\n  const [enteredPass, setEnteredPass] = useState('');\n  const [correctPass, setCorrectPass] = useState(!unauthorized);\n  const [clientData, setClientData] = useState(data)\n  const {content, language, expiry, title} = clientData;\n\n  const getWithPassword = (password, errorCallback) =\u003e {\n    resolvePaste(hash, password)\n      .then(resp =\u003e {\n        setCorrectPass(true)\n        setClientData(resp.data)\n      })\n      .catch(e =\u003e errorCallback(e.response.data))\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n      {!error \u0026\u0026 \u003cNextHead data={data} /\u003e}\n      ...\n      \u003cPasteInfo\n        hash={hash}\n        lang={language}\n        theme={theme}\n        expiry={expiry}\n        err={unauthorized ? '' : error}\n      /\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  );\n}\n\nexport default ViewPaste\n```\n\n### Deployment\nGreat! At this point, everything was working great -- locally. Every developer knows just how much of a leap it is to go from local machine to hosted and on the cloud. Right?\n\nMy first thought was to see how difficult it would be to port my existing frontend on Firebase Hosting to run using Next.js instead. Turns out I would've needed to enable Firebase Functions and to do that I needed to enable the Blaze plan (pay as you go). Seeing just [how much of a hassle the process was](https://dev.to/rowaxl/what-i-struggled-with-next-js-using-firebase-hosting-and-enable-ssr-4e67) made me look for other alternatives. \n\nVercel really surprised me with how easy it was to get setup. All I had to do was signup for Vercel using my GitHub account and select a repository to import. It took a total of 5 minutes to go from GitHub repo to deployed website which was a first.\n\nFunnily enough, the hardest part of this entire deployment process was deleting the old frontend off of Firebase. I accidentally deleted the entire project (including my Cloud Run deployed backend) twice and quite nearly misconfigured my domain.\n\n## Impact\nAll in all, trading 6 hours for such a huge quality-of-life improvement on a project that I personally use a lot has been absolutely worth it. To list a few tangible improvements:\n\n* Smoother user experience (no more annoying 'loading paste...' messages)\n* Cleaner codebase\n* Better link previews (sending links to friends)\n  \nIf you haven't had the chance to try Next.js out for yourself and you've made it this far, you owe it to yourself to at least give it a shot. Thanks to the HackClub community (specifically [Rishi](https://rishi.cx/), [Safin](https://safin.dev/), and [Ani](https://anirudhb.github.io/)) for their constant encouragement and criticism of my 'outdated' tech stack.\n\n**Source Code**: https://github.com/jackyzha0/ctrl-v\n\n**Try it out for yourself**: https://ctrl-v.app/","lastmodified":"2022-02-15T20:23:08.837479373Z","title":"Rewriting ctrl-v using Next.js"},"/posts/digital-gardening":{"content":"\u003e As of 2021, this process is no longer accurate. I've embraced a much more networked form of note taking which I've written about [here](posts/networked-thought.md).\n\nThe first image that comes to my head when I hear the word 'gardening' is of a small plot with some leafy greens sprouting their heads from an earthy bed. A gardener tenderly shovels and removes unwanted weeds and pours water to nourish the plants he wants to grow. He takes care to make sure the soil isn't too wet and that each plant has ample space to grow. When the time comes, he harvests each fruit and vegetable and makes sure to plant seeds so that he can repeat the process anew in a few weeks time.\n\nA garden is a metaphor for a lot of things: growth, persistence, and the constant battle against entropy.\n\nWhen I talk about digital gardening, I don't mean digital gardening in the Stardew Valley or FarmVille sense. I mean gardening as in the tending and growth of my own ideas and projects on my own little plot of the world wide web -- namely through my writing, notes, and projects. After reading Joel Hook's blog post on his own [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden), I've been thinking and reflecting on my own processes for managing my own digital garden (which you are on right now).\n\n## The garden plot\nAccording to [GitHub](https://github.com/jackyzha0/blog/commit/74f7460c49a7c56acfadf3f8f1cdd892005ebed4), I first created this blog in late August of [2020](posts/2020.md). At the time, it was more of a novelty thing. I wanted to get off of Medium and onto my own platform where I had more fine-grained control over how I could present my work and how people discover it.\n\nI spent a few hours building out my own Hugo theme, making it as frictionless as possible to write produce new content. I threw up a few of my old Medium blog posts just to see how it would look, and I was happy with it. However, even with the novelty of the blog, I had nothing to write about.\n\nThe plot was there; I just didn't have anything to plant in it.\n\n![The Garden Plot](/posts/images/digital-gardening/plot.png)\n\n## Planting the seeds\n\nIf you have no seeds in your garden, the only things that will grow are weeds. I could barely remember the last time I read a book on my own time. Needless to say, garbage in, garbage out.\n\nOver the summer, I began to read again. Technical write-ups, fiction novels, traversing into self-help, and memoirs. I started to read more about the state of the world and critically discuss these with family and friends. Reading helped me colour in the lines as to why we need to build in the first place. I started to realize that the problems we try so hard to solve with technology are not actually tech problems, but inherently human ones.\n\nI've started to write more about some these ideas (like within this blog post!), at first to help me organize my own thoughts, but eventually segued into an excuse for me to talk to people about interesting ideas and get their perspective. It's started a sort of chain reaction, with observations from a book leading to a conversation with a friend to a blog post ad infinitum. I've been able to slowly build up my [base of knowledge](/posts/collaborative-thinking) so that I can contribute meaningfully to conversations.\n\nThese are the seeds I plant in my garden, but these seeds will stay seeds unless watered.\n\n![Planting the seeds](/posts/images/digital-gardening/seeds.png)\n\n## Watering the plants\n\nI have a Notion page of random thoughts and ideas. Whenever I come across something interesting in a conversation or book or article, I file it away in this Notion page. Slowly, categories have appeared as blog posts, articles, and papers coalesce and self-organize.\n\nThis input of information -- the water -- is what allows the ideas to grow. Just as it's not enough to just water a plant once and forget about it, I've found that in-taking information inconsistently is about as good as not doing it at all. To be an effective watering can, I need to be intentional and consistent with my watering.\n\nMy process of collecting random scraps of information first sprung up from coming across interesting blog posts on Reddit. I'd always just read a cool post, follow a few hyperlinks, nod to myself and say \"huh\", and maybe forward it to a friend or two. While it may have been entertaining to read, I got no value out of it. Now that I've started cultivating this garden of ideas, I have a reason to be more intentional in how I sift through the information and be more mindful of what I'm actually taking away from each piece. Writing, specifically on this blog and on my newsletter (which you can subscribe to at the bottom of this page), has helped me to go back to more mature ideas and condense and refine them into something presentable and legible to others -- quite literally picking the fruit of my labour. \n\n\u003e We are all constantly bombarded with information, a lot of it is really good information too, but the challenge is absorbing it and applying it to the context of our lives and careers. \u0026mdash; Joel Hooks\n\nNow that I have all of these new-found ideas and tidbits of information, what do I do with them? Keep growing them forever? At some point on the [exploit explore](thoughts/exploit%20explore.md) tradeoff, this knowledge should be applied to something in order to manifest it into something useful. The problem is, which ideas get priority of my time and effort?\n\n![Watering the plants](/posts/images/digital-gardening/watering.png)\n\n## Pulling weeds\n\nNo garden has unlimited space or nutrition to go around. Maybe you have a bigger garden than most, but that doesn't mean you can grow whatever you want silly-willy. Some will need more space than others and others you simply just cannot grow in the same garden plot.\n\nSimilarly, no one has unlimited time and energy they can put into projects and learning. I, unfortunately, have yet to fully learn this lesson. After having an empty plot for so long, having a little greenery show up has inspired me into a planting frenzy, trying to cram as much into the garden as possible.\n\nI'm starting to step back and reflect on my current commitments and deciding to either to step down from things that I'm less passionate about to make more time and room to double down on the things I'm truly passionate about.\n\n![Pulling weeds](/posts/images/digital-gardening/weeds.png)\n\n## End\n\nNone of what I do is perfect. Looking back at writing from a year ago, reading code from a few months ago even, makes me cringe a little. Like any garden, this one evolves and grows over time; there is no 'end-state' that I'm trying to get the garden to. This little garden is just a little place for me to experiment, to push out things that I'm working on, and to provide snapshots of all the in-progress things going on in my life.\n\nThrough tending to this garden [in public](thoughts/building%20in%20public.md), I hope to show my success, failures, and everything in between and offer it as an open garden to learn from for anyone who stumbles upon it in the future. If just one person is inspired by it, learns from a mistake I made, or builds off of my work, then I would consider this garden a success.\n\nMaybe you'll find this as an incentive to start your own.","lastmodified":"2022-02-15T20:23:08.837479373Z","title":"Digital Gardening"},"/posts/docker":{"content":"Content from my own ['Docker Explained' repo](https://github.com/jackyzha0/docker-explained). Check out the repository for example code!\n\n## Introduction\n### What is Docker?\nDocker is a tool that makes it really easy to package applications into self-sustaining 'containers'.\n\n### What are containers?\nContainers, as their name suggests, contain things. In the case of Docker, these contain all the parts the application needs to run, everything from libraries and dependencies to the actual source code.\n\n### Why containers?\nContainerization means that everything to do with your application stays inside the container. You shouldn't need to worry about how stuff on your machine (e.g. which version of Python you have) affects how your program runs. As a side benefit, this means that Docker containers are dependency-free. Never worry about \"oh, it works on my machine\" ever again! After a Docker image is created, all of its contents are frozen so it should work exactly the same on your computer as it does for someone else (assuming you both have Docker).\n\n### Why Docker?\nDocker makes it super easy to work with these containers and, by proxy, you can get all the cool benefits of containers easily too! It also allows you to programmatically define a container through code, meaning you can collaborate and work on Docker containers just as you would with a regular piece of code through version control like `git`.\n\n## Installing Docker\nMore detailed instructions can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).\n\n## Parts of Docker\n### Docker Containers\nI think the intro covered this pretty well so I'll repeat it again here.\n\n\u003e Containers, as their name suggests, contain things. In the case of Docker, these contain all the parts the application needs to run, everything from libraries and dependencies to the actual source code.\n\nThis means that 'containerized' applications don't need to rely on a system to have certain dependencies (e.g. `Node.js`) installed on the user's system to run because the container will have it packaged.\n\nYou can think of Docker containers like a fully self-contained and running version of your application.\n\n### Docker Image\nYou can think of Docker images like a sort of 'template' that describes to Docker how to create a container from scratch. You can build these images by providing instructions on how to build them in the form of layers.\n\n### Layers\nDocker images, like ogres (or cakes if you're a boring person), have many layers. The base layer often provides some basic functionality like providing `git`, `bash` or `apt` -- otherwise your container has nothing to run off of! We can then add our own layers on top of that base layer, like installing dependencies, copying files into the image, and defining the command to run when the container starts up. These instructions are programmatically defined through a Dockerfile.\n\n\u003e One of the coolest parts of Docker is that these layers get cached between builds if nothing has changed. That means that if you rebuild an image and only changed the last layer, it'll only need to rebuild the last layer rather than rebuilding the whole image, making for some really fast iteration times.\n\n### Dockerfile\nThe Dockerfile are the actual specific instructions for how to create the actual image or 'template'. The Dockerfile starts off by defining a 'base-layer', which serve as the basis for your actual image. Some common base layers are `ubuntu` (which contains a minimal install of the actual Ubuntu operating system) and `python` (which contains everything needed to run a basic Python app). \n\nI won't dive into too much details about each command you can use as these will be described more in-depth within the examples. You can find detailed documentation on the commands you can use in a Dockerfile here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/\n\n## Docker CLI\nGreat, so now I know a little bit about how Docker actually works, how do I get started? First, let's make sure our Docker install works correctly. You can do this by opening your favourite terminal and entering `docker run hello-world`. You should get something that looks like:\n\n```bash\n$ docker run hello-world\n\nHello from Docker.\nThis message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.\n...\n```\n\nNow, let's go over a few basic CLI commands that you'll probably be using as you work with Docker.\n\n### `docker build`\n\u003e How do I turn a Dockerfile into an actual image? \n\nTo built an image, you can do `docker build . -t \u003cname-of-image\u003e` which tells Docker to look in the current directory for a file called `Dockerfile` and to follow the instructions inside to build an image. After doing so, tag the image so we can easily find it later. Docker image tags let you version your images as well. Say you wanted to build a v1 for your image, you would do `docker build . -t \u003cname-of-image\u003e:v1`. If you have a different name for your Dockerfile, you can also refer to it using the `-f` flag like so: `docker build . -t \u003cname-of-image\u003e -f \u003cname-of-dockerfile\u003e`\n\nMore info can be found here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/\n\n### `docker image ls`\n\u003e How do I get a list of all the images I've built?\n\nThe command will give you an output that looks something like the following.\n\n```bash\nREPOSITORY                 TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE\nimage1                     0.1.1               9eb95c7f06b0        2 days ago          343MB\nimage2                     \u003cnone\u003e              c99ac06cf60a        2 days ago           23MB\n...\n```\n\nMore info can be found here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/image_ls/\n\n### `docker run`\n\u003e How do I create a container from an image?\n\nNow that you've built an image, you can just run it by doing `docker run \u003cname-of-container\u003e:\u003cversion\u003e`. More often than not, you can just use the latest version of the image, `docker run \u003cname-of-container\u003e:latest`. However, certain applications (like servers) need to listen on specific ports. By default, Docker doesn't allow containers to use ports on your local machine, but you can allow this by specifying ports using the `-p` flag, `docker run -p \u003chost-port\u003e:\u003ccontainer-port\u003e \u003cname-of-container\u003e`. If your container listens on port 3000, but you want it to appear as port 5000 on your local machine, it would look like `docker run -p 5000:3000 \u003cname-of-container\u003e`\n\nIf you want to run your container in the background in a detached manner, you can just add the `-d` flag.\n\nMore info can be found here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/\n\n### `docker ps`\n\u003e How do I figure out what containers are currently running?\n\nYou can get a list of currently running containers by doing `docker ps`, which will give you each container running along with details about its Container ID, what image it was created from, when it was created, as well as which ports are open.\n\n### `docker exec`\n\u003e How do I run a command inside a container?\n\nYou can use the command `docker exec -it \u003ccontainer name\u003e /bin/bash` to get a bash shell in the container, allowing you to run commands from within the container as if it was a full-fledged machine. If you know specifically what command you want to execute, you can use `docker exec -it \u003ccontainer name\u003e \u003ccommand\u003e` to execute whatever command you specify in the container.\n\n## Docker Examples\n1.

What's all the hype about? Basically, its the [single responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle) but applied to services. This means that each responsibility should, ideally, be split out into its own service and be completely responsible for that one thing. This lends itself really easily to Docker and containers. Kubernetes is a system that makes it really easy to deploy, scale, and manage a bunch of containers, making it near ideal in creating a microservices architecture using Docker.\n* https://microservices.io/\n* https://medium.com/hashmapinc/the-what-why-and-how-of-a-microservices-architecture-4179579423a9\n* https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/\n* https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/\n* https://opensource.com/article/17/11/getting-started-kubernetes\n\n## Deploying to the Cloud\nNow that you got some cool new containers?

Wake up -- the drone is **flying**!\"\n\nHalf of our team had been sleeping for the past hour and a bit. Acceptable, considering the time was now 2:42 am. The drone was whirring midair in our little room, nearly getting snagged on our laptops, chargers, and free event swag. Beside us, a blackboard wall displayed a rough chalk diagram of our technical architecture. We had roughly 20 hours left in the hackathon and now that the drone worked, our biggest roadblock was out of the way — it was time to build! We grabbed a plate of cold noodles from the meal line and ran past the crowd of people doing cup stacking competitions, karaoke, and Smash tournaments.\n\nThere is something truly special about being able to manifest an idea into reality, that's what pulled me into hackathons in the first place. Anytime I went to a hackathon not knowing anyone, I left with a new group of friends and mentors and a handful of new skills. I've learned a sizeable amount of my technical knowledge through workshops and hackathon projects. These events inspired me to be intellectually curious. To this day, they're the main reason why I still to this day spend hours tinkering on projects and exploring new ideas.\n\nIn comparison, something feels different about the vast majority of hackathons held today. Recent hackathons may have all the bells and whistles of earlier events, featuring elaborate meal plans and free bubble tea, but it feels performative at best. When asking most people about why they want to go to a hackathon, most people will mention something about the prizes, the recruiting, or the free t-shirts with company logos plastered over them. There is an unavoidable corporate air to the events.\n\nHowever, this transition goes much further back than just the past few years. The origin of the more 'modern,' corporate hackathons arose out of corporate spaces like Facebook, which coopted design spaces like hackathons to further their hiring pipelines or to maintain their outward appearance being 'cool' to work for.[^1]\n\nThis corporate co-optation of hacker culture at hackathons has been on the back of my mind ever since reading the chapter on design sites in [*Design Justice*](thoughts/Design%20Justice.md) by Sasha Costanza-Chock. As someone who first got their footing in computer science through hackathons, it pains me to see that this is the rep that hackathons have slowly gotten over time, moving from safe spaces for idea exploration to increasingly corporate, competitive events where hackers spin up apps to test company products in exchange for the slim chance of winning prizes and recognition.\n\nHow did we get here?\n\n## Hacker Culture\nThe hacker subculture formed mainly out of the collaborative (and often competitive) DIY ethic of the [counterculture](thoughts/From%20Counterculture%20to%20Cyberculture.md) of the 1960s. This was the generation of the '[Hackers](thoughts/Hackers.md),' those interested in figuring things out as they go and invented for the *pure ecstasy of building and learning new things*. As Steven Levy defines it, 'hacks' were projects undertaken by these hackers not to fulfill any sort of end goal other than to take pleasure from working on it.[^2]\n\nThe congregation of hackers eventually led to the creation of alternative design and hackerspaces like hackathons. These very first hackathons were gatherings of excited groups of people ready to build something cool over the weekend.\n\nThese spaces were described as originally being \"third spaces\" outside of the influence of the state and the capitalist market.[^3] Yet, without intentional intervention, it is difficult for these design spaces to even uphold their claim as spaces for intellectual exploration for all, as they become dominated mostly by the privileged to expend free time and income, and overrun by corporations clamouring to sponsor hackathons in order to get as much cheap testing on their products as possible, shoving discount code after free credits at each hacker.\n\n**These design sites used to be valorized as places of learning, making, and building. Why then, have they become increasingly corporate places of extraction of free labour?**\n\n## [Incentive](thoughts/incentives.md) Structure of Hackathons\n![Stacks of hackathon stickers ready for hackers' laptops](/posts/images/hackathons/swag.jpg)*Stacks of hackathon stickers ready for hackers' laptops*\n\nIt takes money to run events. Providing an adequate venue, food, internet, and power are not free resources. Yet, with the exception of a few corporate hackathons, the majority of hackathons remain free for attendees. To accomplish this, most hackathon organizers decide to try to acquire monetary sponsorships, food partnerships, and in-kind sponsorships in order to offset costs.\n\nAs a result a viscious cycle forms:\n1. Sponsors try to maximize the benefits they get for their money (e.g. hosting workshops, hiring booths, keynote speakers, company branding)\n2. With more money, hackathon organizers increase the size and scope of the event, leading to more hackers\n3. Hackers see sponsors as increasingly quintessential to the hackathon experience, being a key reason why hackers attend the events (sponsor prizes, free merch, hiring opportunities, etc.)\n4. Repeat\n\nThis leads to some key downstream effects on hackathon culture.\n\n### Prize Incentives\n\u003e \"People are now prioritizing their projects for the dollar value of prizes and the clout of awards. There is a trend where more and more attendees no longer come in to learn and make memories. Teams are now arriving to hackathons fully formed, with an idea in hand, and a checklist of the prizes they want to win.\" -- [Jonathon Xu](https://jonathanxu.com/blog/2020-07-25-on-hackathons)\n\nIncreasingly so, hackathons have placed more emphasis on prizes rather than building. They prominently display the total value of prizes available to entice hackers to attend, tout the available prizes again at opening ceremonies, and repeatedly blast announcements on them during hacking hours. Even DevPost, the 'homepage' for hackathons, organizes hackathons by how much there is to reap. Then again, who wouldn't want a free iPad and tens of thousands in cash prizes and online subscriptions?\n\n![DevPost Top Hackathon categories by prize pool](/posts/images/hackathons/devpost.png)*DevPost Top Hackathon categories by prize pool*\n\nUnfortunately, this [incentive](thoughts/incentives.md) structure attracts people to hackathons for the wrong reasons. Individuals are motivated to tick boxes on a judging rubric rather than to learn and build new skills on a solid foundation; people who *are* there to learn are pushed to try and compete for prizes instead. Beginners, who may have wanted to just learn how to build a website, are instead cajoled into unsustainably trying to learn how to build something completely out of their skill range, becoming frustrated and losing sleep in the process. This is not to say that pushing hackers outside of their comfort range is a bad thing, but there is a limit to how much useful knowledge is retained after patching together APIs and blindly copying tutorials.\n\nThese incentive structures push hackers to tailor projects specifically for prizes to see just how many sponsor prizes they can shotgun for. In most of these cases, hackers don't dare build outside of their comfort zone, instead choosing to work with technology they are already familiar with or project ideas they know have been successful in the past (don't say you haven't seen a gamifying volunteering or smart garbage bin hack before).\n\n### Short Term Optimization\n\u003e \"A one day hack for homelessness takes away from the complexity of social justice issues… you can't just come up with an app that solve the world's problems\" -- Design Justice[^3]\n\nMost hackathon projects are unsustainable and are unlikely to be used or continued to be worked on outside of the hackathon. A lot of this practice arises out of the Silicon Valley [saviorism problem](https://www.stanforddaily.com/2018/02/16/silicon-valleys-saviorism-problem/) and \"[move fast and break things](thoughts/move%20fast%20and%20break%20things.md)\" attitude. [^7] \n\nThe problem with this approach is that it becomes incredibly reductionist. Hacks nearly always focus on problems and rarely build on existing knowledge and work in the field, often ignoring important context about the issues they so readily reduce to a single web app. Ever seen an app claiming to solve the fentanyl crisis or healthcare for the elderly? People think hackathons can do things that they usually can't, such as solve global problems, create new products overnight, or 'level the playing field' of innovation through meritocracy.[^3]\n\nHackathons, as they stand today, seem to optimize for short term excitement, and not so much for long term benefit. But this short-term burst of new products and ideas is exactly what corporations need to fuel their endless hunger for products, testing, and new talent.\n\n## Corporate Cooptation\n\n![Cupstacking, a commonplace hackathon activity](/posts/images/hackathons/cooptation.jpg)*Cupstacking, a commonplace hackathon activity*\n\nCompanies realized that the attendees of these design spaces would *readily* give up their free time to build potentially marketable products. If hackers so readily built things in their own time, why couldn't we co opt these for the company? Hackers provided a source of interesting ideas that could be milked, and, as a result, the creative outputs of these hackerspaces were \"suddenly highly acclaimed, applied, and copy-pasted into capitalist developing laboratories.\"[^5]\n\nThe free market has warped the hacker ethos and hackerspaces into something almost unrecognizable from what it was supposed to stand for. This set of values which may have worked well for small startups or individuals just doesn't scale well for an entire industry. Sharon Zukin and Max Papadantonakis in their work *Hackathons as Co-optation Ritual* describe three quasi-Orwellian principles that describe this new hacker culture: Work is Play, Exhaustion is Effervescent, and Precarity is Opportunity.[^1]\n\n### Work is Play\n\u003e \"Forget about work-life balance. It's all about work-life _integration._ Why else would the office have on-site acupuncture, nap pods, and free dinner after 7 pm?\" -- [Arielle Pardes, WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/how-silicon-valley-ruined-work-culture)\n\nThe initial hacker ethos of wanting to 'innovate' was evident in how vehemently startups disowned the 9-to-5 cubicle life. Walk into any tech company office building and you'd barely be able to tell if it was supposed to be a corporate office or adult playground with all the ping pong tables and colourful decor. The expectation was for employees to treat coworkers as family, office as home, and work as play.\n\nBut this playful front is not exactly as it seems. A [2017 study](https://businessresearcher.sagepub.com/sbr-1863-102641-2779724/20170508/more-companies-offering-unlimited-time-off) by Sage Business Researcher found that employees who work in offices with these benefits tend to stay in the office longer after work, pushing individuals to spend more and more of their lives in the office. Corporations frame events like hackathons as fun events to attend in an effort to appeal to the hacker ethos and to maintain their public image of 'coolness'. Disguised under the nerf gun fights, ping pong tables, and free food is a more sinister intent to treat work as play. Is it wrong to love what you do and treat it as play? No, but corporations shouldn't conflate the hacker ethos with a willingness to 'play' at work.\n\n### Exhaustion is Effervescent\n\u003e \"There are way easier places to work, but nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week\" -- [Elon Musk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1067173497909141504)\n\n100 hour work weeks and 'hustle culture' are becoming increasingly normalized by tech moguls like Elon Musk. Being constantly tired is somewhat of a [status icon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_o7qjN3KF8U) as individuals boast about how little sleep they got.\n\nIt has been disturbingly normalized and even celebrated that exhaustion is a sign of strength. Among a [global sleep-loss pandemic](https://www.theguardian.com/business-to-business/2017/dec/04/clocking-off-the-companies-introducing-nap-time-to-the-workplace), events like hackathons which push for attendees to stay up for lengths of 24 to 36 hours are particularly worrisome.\n\nI am viscerally reminded of sharing a hard gym floor with dozens of other sleep-deprived hackers, taking shifts to sleep so some people can stay up to work on the hack. Despite the timeboxed nature of hackathons, there is no reason purposefully staying up all night should be quintessential to the hackathon experience.\n\nPhysical and mental health should not be \"instrumentalized in service of being useful to a startup mission, or even a life philosophy.\"[^7] These events set the precedence of what the next generation of engineers, builders, and designers consider as 'normal' for the industry. Why are we saying that it's okay to prioritize 'success' above personal wellbeing?\n\n### Precarity is Opportunity\nThe startup and hustle culture heavily idolizes those who live precarious lifestyles. *High risk, high reward*. The industry has normalized high turnover rates and job-hopping, with companies like Google and Amazon reporting median tenures of around a year, compared to the national average of 4.1 years.[^6]\n\nToday, the majority of tech employment consists of internships, contract work, short tenures at medium to large companies, and precarious work at startups. Because of the incredulous demand for tech jobs, candidates have considerably more leverage than employers do in offer negotiations, with individuals often using competing offers between companies to renege better signing bonuses and compensation.\n\nWhile not precarious in the traditional labour sense, the employment itself is unstable and temporary. The concept of a 'life-long job' just doesn't exist in this industry. As a result, individuals are constantly asked to market themselves for continually shifting jobs.\n\nSimilarly, these coopted design spaces reshape precarious and unpaid work from exploitative to opportunity. Writing code and building apps for free becomes something to be clamoured and competed over. In other words, \"institutions use the allure of hackathons, with sponsors, prizes, snacks, and potential for career advancement, to get people to work for free.\"[^4]\n\n## Reclaiming Design Spaces\n\n![Liminal spaces: The morning after nwHacks 2020](/posts/images/hackathons/liminal_space.jpg)*Liminal spaces: The morning after nwHacks 2020*\n\nMaybe this is the [death of the hackathon](https://jonathanxu.com/blog/2020-07-25-on-hackathons) as we know it, and that might not necessarily be a bad thing. Maybe we can throw away the focus on prizes, winning, and short-term projects and replace it with something better.\n\n### Sustainable Learning\n\u003e The word hackathon is the portmanteau of *hacking marathon*. Why then, do we treat it like a sprint?\n\nThe 'finish a complete project in two days' mindset of hackathons rarely transfers well into the real world. Realistically, most projects are complex in scope and attempting to reduce complex problems down to a one-weekend hack omits a lot of context and nuance that is often important.\n\nWork done at hackathons should be toward long-term sustainable processes instead of short term precarious work. During the past year, there has been a noticeable uptick in design spaces intended to facilitate longer term work like coliving houses, incubators, and fellowships. Hacker houses like [Edyfi](http://edyfi.org/) and [School 2.0](https://school2point0.com/) give individuals the option to work on existing projects or scale new ones in a supportive community. A few organizations like the Cal Hacks Foundation are pioneering initiatives in this space with programs like the [Cal Hacks Fellowship](https://fellowship.calhacks.io/) (a semester-long idea accelerator that invites teams to build beyond their side-projects) and [Hack Month](https://hackmonth.calhacks.io/) (which is a month-long build-a-thon focused on recentering the fun of building). MLH is also working on non-hackathon initiatives like the [MLH Fellowship](https://fellowship.mlh.io/) and the [Local Hack Day](https://localhackday.mlh.io/) workshops that refocus learning and maintenance rather than just blind creation. I've even noticed more individuals starting larger-scale personal projects that happen on the order of weeks to months rather than single days.\n\nEncouraging the growth of more sustainable skill building enables individuals to take into account a more holistic view of problems. Hopefully, this leads to building longer term, larger scope, and bigger impact projects and skills.\n\n### Places of [play](thoughts/play.md)\nDo we so necessarily need to tie rituals of play in building and tinkering to the recruiting and product testing pipeline for large corporations? Hopefully the answer to that question is no.\n\nYet even today, a majority of communities focused around building like [YCombinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) or [OnDeck](https://www.beondeck.com/) are ultimately not places of play – they have external outcomes they'd like to achieve. We should create dedicated spaces for exploration and learning *without* needing to justify it via some specific outcome. This is not to say that spaces with those goals in mind are bad, but giving individuals the option to have a space for unfettered exploration can give them the freedom to explore ideas that may not have clear monetary value in the short term. Communities like [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/) and [Reboot](https://reboothq.substack.com/) do this particularly well. There is no central 'goal' of trying to launch a product or anything, but rather it's a group of individuals that are intellectually curious and want to learn and build cool things.\n\nThe goal is to provide the infrastructure so that *everyone* can play, not just those privileged enough to throw spare income and time at it. Hackathon organizers shouldn't assume that everyone is able and willing to stay up the entire event and barely set aside enough time for meals. It is important to consider food, bio breaks, accessible bathrooms that are friendly to all body types and genders, comfortable spaces to nap or relax, and decent lighting, etc.[^3]\n\n## Moving Forward\n![A project demo at nwHacks 2020](/posts/images/hackathons/reclaiming.jpg)*A project demo at nwHacks 2020*\n\nIf well-organized, hackathons can provide a fertile ground for pathways to employment as well as being a place of exploration. Those identities don't need to be mutually exclusive. My argument here is that hackathons have recently placed too much emphasis on the pathways to employment; the main focus of design spaces like hackathons should be on hackers, not sponsors. Even for lower-income students, the 'employment' opportunities are usually short-term and precarious. Of course, sponsorship and money does have a role in making these hackathons possible, but not to the scale we've come to expect at these events.\n\n### The Future of Hackathons\nWhat might the future of the hackathon look like, if not what it is now? \n\n* **Emphasis on sustainable learning**. Realistically, hackers will not *learn* if all they did was copy tutorials off the internet. Most learning happens through sharing between individuals and teams. Hopefully, we can bake this into the hackathon structure by creating cohorts of hackers for [parallel play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_play) and refocus the hackathon as a means to [learn and explore](thoughts/Mindstorms.md) for the sake of learning and exploring rather than to hit the checkboxes on a rubric.\n* **Realistic Scoping**. Too many of today's hackathons boast that they focus on creating 'hacks for social good.' The reality of the situation is that these complex and nuanced societal problems *cannot* be solved overnight with a simple web app. Either we stop advertising hackathons for good on the timescale of a single weekend, or we increase the timescale of the hackathon from a weekend to months or even years.\n* **Deprioritization of prizes and winning**. Instead, we should provide a space for hackers to play and explore ideas. Obviously in an ideal world, both can happen at the same time, but the rubric-based approach that most hackathons take make these almost mutually exclusive. For now, let's incentivize participation, completion, and novelty over prizes, competition, and winning.\n* **Hacker-focused spending**. Money spent on often unsustainable swag could be much better spent in favour of more emphasis on higher quality venues, food, and accomodations. In doing so, we can work on raising enough money to run a successful event for the hackers rather than a sponsor's notion of a successful event. At the end of the day, money is power. If you have external [funding](thoughts/funding.md) coming in, the expectation is that they have partial influence over the event. Let's make sure that we draw the line where appropriate with sponsors so that the focus remains on the hacker. \n\n### A Promising Pilot\nThe sudden switch to virtual events due to COVID-19 may actually have been the catalyst to the potential future of hackathons. Virtual hackathons this year have shown how successfully we can run events on low budgets that are often 1/10th of our regular running budget. This means we were able to shave off swag, venue, transportation, and food costs to just a tiny fraction of what they used to be. This taste of what hacker-centric hackathons could be like was incredibly exciting to see, almost a glimpse into what the future of hackathons could look like.\n\n![After HackCamp 2020](/posts/images/2020/post-hc.png)*After HackCamp 2020*\n\nThis year, I was responsible for leading logistics at our beginner-focused hackathon called [HackCamp](https://hackcamp.nwplus.io/). To recentre hackathons around learning and to rebuild a healthier hacker culture, we decided to restructure our event into a virtual conference weekend. Here are a few things we changed:\n\n1. We separated learning and workshops from building and hacking and turned it into a two-day hackathon. This allowed hackers to attend workshops and learn without fear of missing out on precious hacking time and to have scheduled sleeping time between the Learn and Build days.\n2. We replaced our 'top' hackathon project awards with a $25 donation to charity for every project submitted. In the past, we've had feedback from hackers saying how this gave them the confidence to finish a project rather than to fail and give up working on the 'perfect' or 'winning' project.\n3. All events were live streamed. This meant that hackers could do the event on their own time and rewatch important events like opening ceremonies while still providing a 'live' viewing experience for those who are available.\n4. We changed judging to be focused on feedback rather than on evaluation. To do so, we replaced exposition judges (who were normally volunteers or company sponsors) with hackers and did peer-to-peer judging. With this approach, each team averaged 7 pieces of feedback.\n\nAlthough this is by no means a full overhaul of the traditional hackathon, we think this is a great pilot into what a more explorative hackathon could look like. We were able to reach over 500+ attendees, 3.2k+ live stream viewers, and over $1200 in donations to charities, and the feedback we got was absolutely stellar.\n\n### Takeaways\nHaving more of the tools to articulate and locate exactly why hackathons have felt increasingly corporate is the first step to reinstate hackathons as third spaces not as places of competition and exploitation, but as places of play and exploration. Hackathons have so much potential to be safe havens for people to find like-minded people away from school assignments or startup grinds or corporate products. \n\nLet's hack the hackathon. This time, with hackers first, not companies. \n\n*Special thanks to Anson, Joice, Ivan, Jasmine, and Jess for reading and helping edit earlier drafts :)*\n\n[^1]: [Hackathons as Co-optation Ritual: Socializing Workers and Institutionalizing Innovation in the \"New\" Economy](https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1575\u0026context=gc_pubs)\n[^2]: [From Counterculture to Cyberculture](https://fredturner.stanford.edu/books/from-counterculture-to-cyberculture/)\n[^3]: [Design Justice: Community-Led Practices To Build the Worlds We Need](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/design-justice)\n[^4]: [*Wired* on Hackathons and Exploitation](https://www.wired.com/story/sociologists-examine-hackathons-and-see-exploitation/)\n[^5]: [Post-it Note City](https://placesjournal.org/article/post-it-note-city)\n[^6]: [*Forbes* on High Turnover Rate in Tech](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinessdevelopmentcouncil/2018/06/29/the-real-problem-with-tech-professionals-high-turnover)\n[^7]: [Beyond Instrumentalization](https://letterstoayoungtechnologist.com/Value-Beyond-Instrumentalization) by Jamie Wang","lastmodified":"2022-02-15T20:23:08.837479373Z","title":"Hacking the Hackathon"},"/posts/hootsuite":{"content":"(with insights from Calvin and Hobbes)\n\nSince I’ve started at Hootsuite, I have\n\n* added and/or changed 6223 lines of code in 16 different repos\n\n* closed 24 tickets\n\n* made 4 new Slack emotes\n\n* listened to almost 10,000 minutes of lofi\n\n* had 1 amazing summer at Hootsuite\n\nIncluding the amount of money I’ve spent on lunch this past summer, everything has been so much more than I expected it to be.

Everything at Hootsuite has served to be a once-in-a-lifetime learning opportunity, from learning to build complex services in languages that I’ve never even heard to doing technical demos in front of the entire Product Development team. Despite being a ‘software development’ position, I found myself learning to be a better technical communicator, to have better personal confidence, and so much more.\n\nYet among everything, two big lessons stood out to me:\n\n## The balance of life and work\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*Mj-EMJtcvI4hM_jC.jpg)\n\nPeople often say how elusive good work-life balance is, even to the point of saying that it doesn’t exist. Yet, at my 2 months here at Hootsuite, I can positively say that it is alive and well. We’ve hiked almost 44km across 4 different trails in BC, attended music festivals, and even found niche groups for those interested in bouldering. At the office, there is no shortage of Slack memes and free birthday cake either. On a more serious note, the managers and leads here care deeply about their team members and go out of their way to ensure not only their well-being but also their development as a person.\n\n![Mount Seymour Trail Hike with the team!](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/7936/1*eM_TIZGbBJIz485ssMqKTQ.jpeg)*Mount Seymour Trail Hike with the team!*\n\nThis was a big change from high school where a day at school left me completely drained and just ready to crash. Everything was so focused on grinding for results and doing work that it was hard to make time for myself. At Hootsuite, the community made it feel easy and natural to find the balance that worked for me.\n\nI was still working 8 hours a day, but somehow I felt energized and ready for more each day. It motivated me to make time to take on a freelance web development job just for practice (and to pay rent — living in Vancouver is rough) and even to make a simple project for a friend’s birthday!\n\nI know that this has probably been repeated countless times already, but I cannot stress how important it is to make sure you’re taking enough time off to relax.\n\n## Rejection\n\n\u003e Don’t reject yourself before other people get the chance to\n\n![[December 27th, 1985](https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1985/12/27)](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*Psh-fqFgVeQegGay.jpg)*[December 27th, 1985](https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1985/12/27)*\n\nBecomes sometimes, you just gotta go for it. You probably shouldn’t be going around and ruining nice coffee tables, but it works as a metaphor I guess? The point is: take necessary risks. Don’t say “nah, that’s not possible” before someone else tells you it is. At the start of summer, if someone told me I was going to be doing a demo on a proposal for a massive re-architecture of one of Hootsuite’s core services, I would have told you that you were insane. Yet here I am, doing just that:\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3488/1*P8WSSl993SYILSfw9EfCwg.png)\n\nIf your brain is anything like mine, you often get these nagging self-doubts about whether you’re capable of doing something. The first time I was assigned to help define Service Level Objectives ([SLOs](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/service-level-objectives/)) for some of Hootsuite’s core services, I was shocked.\n\u003e They’re letting a high schooler do this? How am I even close to being qualified?\n\nNot wanting to miss the opportunity, I took it. But as I began work, it became clear that I was the biggest critic in the room. They wouldn’t have asked me to do it if they didn’t trust me to do it and to do it well. Moving forward, I tried to trust myself more and to put myself out there, eventually taking on projects that I never thought would’ve been possible:\n\n* Designing prototype service meshes\n\n* Adding endpoints and writing scripts to cleanup user data\n\n* And other crazy things that I probably can’t publicly disclose\n\nIf an opportunity presents itself, jump on it!

The garden is farmland that delights the senses, designed for delight rather than commodity.\" -- [Bernstein](http://www.eastgate.com/garden/Gardens.html)\n\nWe live in an information age. The amount of data we produce far outweighs what we consume, so much so that it has extended far beyond our ability to make meaningful use of it. Even our modern day [search](thoughts/search.md) systems seem to be falling apart under the stress of today's overwhelming flow of data with the quality of our search engines degrading from all of the SEO hacks, paid advertiser content, and clickbait headlines.\n\nOver the past year, I've slowly found processes that have worked well in creating a little curated corner of the internet, rich with wonderfully curious people exploring exciting ideas. You may have noticed I merged my blog and digital garden under my main site. A lot has changed since I last wrote about processes in my [Digital Gardening](posts/digital-gardening.md) post and some are no longer accurate. \n\nThis is a v2.\n\n## What is digital gardening?\nA digital garden is not a file cabinet, nor is it fully an index. A digital garden, in fact, is less so a well-kempt plot for farming and more so a mess of entangled growth. It is a network of interconnected ideas and thoughts, clustered by how they are associated with each other.\n\nThis is not because I don't like order, but because I think **a dash of chaos and entropy is good for new ideas**. They help connect two separate ideas that you normally would not have associated with each other, and to imagine the 'what if' more frequently.\n\nMy goal with a digital garden is not purely as an [organizing system](thoughts/organizing%20system.md) and information store, thought it works nicely for that. I want my digital garden to be a playground for new ways ideas can connect together. As a result, existing formal organizing systems like Zettelkasten or the hierarchical folder structures of Notion don't work well for me. There is way too much upfront friction that by the time I think about how to organize my thought into categories, I've lost it.\n\nThis is the problem with the file cabinet: it focuses on efficiency of access and [interoperability](thoughts/interoperability.md) rather than generativity and creativity. Thinking is not linear, nor is it [hierarchical](thoughts/A%20City%20is%20not%20a%20Tree.md). In fact, not many things are linear or hierarchical at all. Then why is it that most tools and thinking strategies assume a nice chronological or hierarchical order for my thought processes? The ideal tool for thought for me would embrace the messiness of my mind, and organically help insights emerge from chaos instead of forcing an artificial order.\n\n## How I garden\n\u003e Digital gardens focus not on being a definite source of truth, but rather a source which is constantly evolving as your own knowledge grows and changes\n\nMy blog made me scared of posting. I was scared of putting things into the public because I was anxious about all the different ways people could perceive it, both in the present and in the future. What if I posted something that people thought was *stupid*? Or worse yet, somebody would see my current work in the future and look down on me for how naive my thinking was. I was scared of [digital permanence](thoughts/digital%20permanence.md).\n\nBut honestly, the more I wrote and just put things out there, the less that line of thinking made sense. The internet is pretty [ephemereal already](thoughts/ephemereal%20content.md). It's hard enough to *willingly* create something people will remember a week from now, let alone for all of eternity. While this is still a non-zero probability, the consistent outpour of support and interesting comments I *did* get from posting made me feel it was worth it.\n\nI still, by and large, write for myself. Writing, for me, is a form of [knowledge distillation](thoughts/knowledge%20distillation.md). It helps to clarify my thinking and condense my knowledge so I can easily articulate it to others. If done well, I have a **shareable representation of my thoughts** that I can send out into the world and people can respond. Even for my most half-baked thoughts, this helps me create a feedback cycle to strengthen and fully flesh out that idea.\n\nDigital gardening is not just passive knowledge collection. It's a form of expression and sharing. The goal should be to tap into your network's collective intelligence to create constructive feedback loops, not to post content that 'gains clout' or makes you look smart.\n\n\u003e “[One] who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but [they] also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important.” — Richard Hamming\n\nHere are some learnings over the past year of digital gardening:\n- Link by concept rather than by exact match. I will often explicitly have a `Related: (some concept)` link somewhere if I feel two subjects are closely associated. Linking new knowledge to existing knowledge makes it easy to remember. This has helped me find really cool connections on numerous occasions. \n- Name notes to be as simple as possible. I prefer using verbs or nouns to make it easier to link concepts and thoughts.\n- Good [search](thoughts/search.md) matters a lot. When I search, I usually don't know the exact name of the thing I'm looking for, otherwise, why would I be searching for it in the first place? I use search as an entry-point into a single node, *then* recall by associativity rather than by indexing. But having a good entry-point can make or break my flow into finding what I'm looking for. \n\nThis is still a process I'm refining to this day. Likely, my learnings will have grown by the next time around when I rewrite this again.\n\n## Knowledge Flow\nI don't read everything I come across. I am at a point where I am constantly bombarded with new and interesting things from my Twitter Feed, friends, Slack groups, Discord Servers, Telegram DMs, and so much more.\n\nDespite my manic page parking, I really only get time to read about 30% of content sent my way. Even among those 30%, I probably only have meaningful thoughts and connections with about half of those.\n\nI've started developing a process to better manage my process for information intake.\n\n### Seeds\nI am a person who needs a very low friction way to dump new ideas and things to look at in the future.\n\nI use [Draft](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/draft-by-slite/ljkidlijlaapmiilabpldhmhekeionfh?hl=en) by Slite to have a 'scratch space' in my new tab page where I have my running list of todos, temporary thoughts, and things to read in the next little bit. It's my Apple Notes for my laptop.\n\nI use [Curius](https://curius.app/) to keep a backlog of things that are interesting but not interesting enough for me to read at this exact moment.\n\nActually, on reflection, I tend to generally bookmark things for later then revisit them when I have time. For [projects](thoughts/idea%20list.md), writing, and all sorts of reading. Even when reading books, I don't like to take complex notes right away will only bookmark or highlight phrases. I will eventually come back to the bookmarks a second time to generate insights and actual thoughts. It feels like this weeds out unnecessary noise and provides a natural chance for spaced repetition.\n\nThese are the seeds that form the basis of ideas and thoughts.\n\n### Saplings\nSaplings are single nodes or thoughts. When linking notes, I generally do not silo notes into categories. Sometimes, the presence of specific 'folders' or 'topics' prevents us from making surprising connections between otherwise related topics (e.g. [urban planning](thoughts/urban%20planning.md) and [data structures](thoughts/A%20City%20is%20not%20a%20Tree.md)).\n\n### Fruits\nOf course, a knowledge index isn't much use if it doesn't inform future thinking and output. Fruits are what I like to call derivative or 'new' pieces of content.\n\nIt's the act of creating 'newer' work from saplings, mostly longer form essays, projects, etc. At this stage, thoughts and ideas have matured enough to be able to share and collaborate. Right now,  traditional '[tools for thought](thoughts/tools%20for%20thought.md)' are not great for this aspect, lacking the ability to publish, edit, and share notes with others.\n\n## Start your own\nI've found having my own digital garden has been immensely helpful. It's created a playground for me to experiment with writing, have an excuse to read, learn, and share with others, and be less scared of putting this out into the public.\n\nThrough tending to this garden [in public](thoughts/building%20in%20public.md), I hope to show my success, failures, and everything in between and offer it as an open garden to learn from for anyone who stumbles upon it in the future. If just one person is inspired by it, learns from a mistake I made, or builds off of my work, then I would consider this garden a success.\n\nMaybe you'll find this as an incentive to start your own.\n\n\u003e I'd like digital garden to be like a bonsai tree. Carefully growing, trimming, pruning, artfully shaping a beautiful tree of resources and ideas\n\n![https://www.are.na/block/2175982](thoughts/images/garden-bird.png)*'Everyone tends his or her own little [epistemological](thoughts/epistemology.md)' garden, growing ideas from seed and sharing them with anyone who comes by.*\n\n[Image Source](https://www.are.na/block/2175982)","lastmodified":"2022-02-15T20:23:08.88547976Z","title":"Networked Thought"},"/posts/new-words":{"content":"---\n\n*This is an expansion of thoughts on [terminology](thoughts/terminology.md) and why we need new words.

Not only does it have some absolutely stunning cover art, it also touches on some thoughts that have been marinating in my head about the intersection of open source and [funding](thoughts/funding.md). So much so, that I’ve started experiencing the Baader-Meinhof effect, seeing something to do with open source and funding everywhere I look in tweets, conversations, and blogs.\n\nThis blog post is an exploration of processes in open source, the value it provides, and how money fits into the picture.\n\n![Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software](/posts/images/paid-oss/oss_book.jpg)*Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software*\n\n### How it's made\n\u003e \"Open source developers were frequently characterized as 'hobby' developers, because the assumption was that only companies could make 'real' software.\"[^1]\n\nAs it stands, there are two primary schools of thought about how open source software is created.\n\n1. **Firm-based** production involves companies, organizations, governments, or any institution with centralized resources. Their driving thesis is that only companies make software because, from a coordination standpoint, centralized firms are the most efficient way to manage resources. Most development done this way is motivated extrinsically by means of monetary compensation.\n   \n2. **Commons-based** production is a more vague concept that involves a distributed group of developers that work on a resource that is used, owned, and governed by its own community - free of  employer affiliations. Most development done this way is motivated intrinsically, people do work because they want to do it.\n\nTraditionally, software has been seen as a product of firms. Open source developers were often treated as hobbyists and the projects they made trivialized as toys. The assumption was that only companies could make ‘real’ software. However, the rise of Internet computing and collaboration tools like Git have decreased the barrier to entry enough that producing software through a commons is now feasible and very much alive. The success of projects like Apache, Linux, and FreeBSD proved just how successful a commons-based method of production could be.\n\nSurprisingly, this may also help to explain why some developers view open source and money as completely separate. If the commons-based method of production is rooted in intrinsic motivation, then money, an extrinsic motivator, will be seen as opposite to core ideals that open source stands for.\n\n\n## [Creation vs Maintenance](thoughts/creation%20vs%20maintenance.md)\n\u003e \"Creation is an intrinsic motivator, maintenance usually requires extrinsic motivation\"\n\u003e\n\u003e @balupton, isaacs/github [#167](https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/167)\n\nWhen an artist finishes a painting, or a runner finishes a marathon, that usually signifies the end of said responsibility. There is no such finish line for an open source project, even after pushing out an initial product.\n\nCreating a project is fun. It’s a wild exploration into a new idea, a frivolous journey to create something useful or to learn something new. As cloud platforms continue to eat the world, the costs of distributing and sharing a project are almost completely nullified.\n\nJust a few clicks and a few taps of your keyboard and your project is readily available to any of the 4.66 billion people around the world with internet access. This adrenaline rush of finally releasing the labour of your work onto the world is the moment developers are constantly chasing. For most developers, the process of creation and distribution is intrinsically motivated; it’s an enjoyable process.\n\n[Maintenance is less so.](thoughts/maintenance.md). This is akin to a writer that’s been asked to edit and revise the same book day in and day out, long after they’ve reaped the initial financial and reputational rewards from its creation. Even when the creator wants to leave the project to work on something else, they can’t. They’re tightly shackled by the fact that hundreds of thousands of other organizations, companies, and tools rely on their code to keep their operations running. Bringing on additional developers may not help either, as they still require onboarding, code reviews, and general guidance.\n\nCode may be nearly free to create and distribute, but maintenance is still expensive.\n\n## Types of code\n### Code as an artifact\nThere are two main ways we can look at code. The first of which is *static* code. Code that, on its own, does nothing but exists as an archive. Others can copy and download the code without incurring any additional costs to the author. For the maintainers, it should make no difference in regards to cost whether 10 or 10,000 people use it.\n\nThis type of code is a pool resource or [public good](thoughts/public%20goods.md), it is\n1. **Non-rivalrous.** My ability to copy the code doesn’t affect your ability to copy it. (This isn’t exactly true due to some marginal costs but I’ll discuss this later)\n2. **Non-excludable.** If someone has a copy of the code, it is very difficult to prevent them from sharing that code with others.\n\nAny code that is in this state is easy to share, copy, and distribute. This is the type of code that lives dormant on Github, on StackOverflow answers, and in GitHub’s Arctic Vault[^2]. However, the main purpose of consuming code is not to simply read and study it, but to actually use it and to let it interact with other code.\nIn doing so, we bring it to life.\n\n\n### Code as an organism\n\u003e \"Open source code derives its value not from its static qualities but from its living ones.\"[^1]\n\nAs soon as you hit CTRL-V on that snippet of code, as soon as that static code is inserted into your own, that code comes to life. It might surface  ridiculous amounts of red squigglies, break other code, or force you to rewrite your previous code just to make it work. When code transitions from a resting static state to an active living state, it starts to incur a set of hidden costs.\n\nLike a living organism in a symbiotic relationship, there is a mutual interdependence between it and others in the software ‘ecosystem’ in order to survive. As a result, this ecosystem requires constant upkeep to ensure that components don’t fall out of balance: dependency bumps, documentation updates, and infrastructure changes.\n\n## Free as in speech, not as in beer\n‘Free’ software doesn’t refer to its price. In fact, ‘free’ software is often extremely expensive. As Richard Stallman first described free software, it’s “free as in speech, not free as in beer.” The point Stallman was trying to make was that ‘free’ refers to what one could do with the software, rather than the price tag.\n\n### Latent cost of software\nIn reality, code in its alive state is more like a free puppy. In the beginning, it’s a great and wonderful thing! Super fun and super cute. As it grows and gets older, you realize “geez, it actually takes a lot of my own time to take care of this thing.” Unlike a piece of inanimate furniture, bringing a living creature into one’s home comes with bringing in a new set of responsibilities too.\n\n**Marginal costs** are costs increase on a per-user basis. I mentioned earlier that these costs mean that software is actually rivalrous, meaning that at some point, the project won’t be able to support the n+1th user. Some of this cost comes from physical infrastructure like code hosting and infrastructure. However, the majority of the cost comes from user support. Say you have a billion users and only 0.1% of them require support. If it takes you roughly 10 minutes to resolve each issue, you would still need 20,833 people working 8-hour shifts a day just to be able to keep up with the support volume. Maintainers are constantly wrestling with keeping their issue volume low and questions answered. Eventually, it just becomes a hindrance preventing them from working on the core product.\n\n**Temporal costs** are those which build up and compound over time. Most of it comes from technical debt, choices that are easier today at the expense of time and money in the future. This is the eternal battle against entropy: the inevitable decay of systems over time. When code changes, all the supporting knowledge that surrounds it must be updated too. Documentation, tutorials, programming books, videos, and more slowly become obsolete.\n\nPaying off these latent costs is seldom intrinsically motivated. When people talk about how fun making new projects is or contributing to open source, it’s never referring to writing documentation or refactoring code. This isn’t the ‘fun’ part of writing software. This is the nasty upkeep that goes into maintaining a building from the 1850s that’s had new rooms, plumbing, and electric wiring frankenstein-ed into it over the years.\n\n## Funding Open Source\nI first started on BentoML[^3] as a casual contributor last summer, submitting a few decently sized PRs. It was almost all intrinsically motivated; I found issues that I enjoyed working on and that I knew I would learn lots from. Satisfied with my experience, I decided to join the team as a paid contractor expecting to just continue the type of work I was doing in the summer. As issue after issue piled on, I slowly started to realize just how much extra work being a maintainer meant and why it was a paid position. Making proposals, triaging issues, adding tests, and writing documentation took up the majority of my time. While I recognized it was important work, it was not work I was intrinsically motivated to do. Thus, to motivate people like me to get that work done, an extrinsic motivator -- in this case, money -- needed to be applied.\n\nHow do we best incentivize maintainers to work tasks stripped of the very excitement and promise of creation that initially drew them to the project in the first place? There is a jarring disconnect between work that is needed versus work that is intrinsically motivated. This is where I believe open source funding should play a role. There are two main potential avenues to go about this.\n\n\n### Funding projects\nOne possibility is to fund projects directly. This route builds a brand around the project. The status of the project then transcends any single person’s contributions and becomes a tangible entity that has the brand recognition and reputation that comes with becoming an independent entity.\n\nProjects also tend to attract corporate/government funding much better than individuals can since companies are more comfortable paying for a product (code) than for a one off contract (talent). As part of the transaction, companies are typically promised service availability, influence in decision making, or technical support. However, this tradeoff also means that projects lose a bit of their freedom. Not only do maintainers have to worry about the future of the project, they need to make sure that the agreements laid out between the project and the companies are met too.\n\n### Funding individuals\nA more individualistic model would provide greater flexibility and avoids the centralized governance issues that are so antithetical to what open source stands for. Maintainers then don’t need to deal with figuring out who should get paid how much as each maintainer is responsible for securing their own funding (if even needed). Unlike a company, what each maintainer looks to get from contributing to a project may look completely different. One may be looking to build technical skill, another to gain reputation in the community. From a governance perspective, funding individual developers is also better aligned with the distributed nature of open source projects too.\n\nAs the world’s media moves towards empowering independent creators through platforms like Twitch, YouTube, and TikTok, funding individuals is becoming an increasingly viable option. The way most of these creators make money is through *patronage* rather than donations. Although often conflated with donations, patronage is an interest and commitment to following a creator’s *future* work based on their *current* reputation rather than a one-time tip for their current work.\n\nWhen you are funding an individual, you are paying for the regular delivery of well-defined value.[^1] There are three key parts to this:\n1. **Paying.** This is an ongoing commitment to the production of content, not a one-off payment for one piece of content that catches the eye.\n2. **Regular Delivery.** It isn't random discovery, rather the content is delivered directly to the user via email or application.\n3. **Well-defined value.** It is clear what the money is going towards and what value it is helping provide.\n\nFunding individuals means trusting not just in the projects they are currently working on, but also that they will continue to deliver future value too. Rather than being tied down to one project, creators then have the creative freedom to apply what they learned and create more groundbreaking initiatives.\n\n## Mixing money and open source\n\u003e **Q:** Won't financial rewards adversely affect developer's [incentives](thoughts/incentives.md) to contribute?\n\u003e \n\u003e **A:** Yes, but it depends on who you're funding.\n\n[Attention](thoughts/attention%20economy.md) is the main currency of production. Attention is what you divert when you choose to focus on prioritizing a feature request over adding support for a library that you promised to add a few months back. Attention is what limits you from doing everything at once.\n\nAttention, then, is a common pool resource. It is non-excludable (anyone can bid for their attention) and rivalrous (limited attention). But, by charging for access to maintainer’s attention, it then becomes a private good: excludable and rivalrous. The belief is that, by making attention excludable, the quality of contributions will increase as contributors and users compete for the attention of producers.\n\nThere are two main camps on funding open source projects. The first camp believes that we should pay all maintainers to keep their projects alive. The other camp believes that paying project maintainers will destroy the entire ideology that open source is based upon.\n\nI stand somewhere in between the two camps. I’m a big proponent of “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” There are a lot of competing motivations already, both intrinsic and extrinsic, that powers open source today. We shouldn’t touch the parts that are currently working. Rather, we should focus on funding places that are absent from existing motivation like software maintenance and documentation\n\n## Conclusion\nThere is an abundance of open source projects and casual contributors as it stands today. With the ever lowering barrier to entry, these will only become more abundant. Casual contributors already incur a marginal cost on maintainers, their contributions need a maintainer to review whether it’s okay to merge or not. Adding more extrinsic motivation will just exacerbate this existing problem. This is the same reason why initiatives like Hacktoberfest, which promises to give a free t-shirt to anyone who makes a few pull requests, are counterproductive to open source.\n\nWhat isn’t significantly increasing are the number of maintainers responsible for maintaining the existing projects we have today. We should be funding maintainers who already have the contextual knowledge to be able to effectively tackle issues and guide the project. Funding will be an important extrinsic motivator to make sure that the difficult work that needs to be done, gets done.\n\nThis is not, by any means, an all-encompassing post about funding in open source. If that’s what you’re looking for, then Eghbal’s book is a great starting point. What this post does do, however, is raise important points about the processes behind open source and prod at why exactly we need to fund these seemingly ‘free’ processes. In order for open source to continue on its growth trajectory, these are questions we need to put more collective effort into thinking about.\n\n[^1]: *Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software* by [Nadia Eghbal](https://nadiaeghbal.com/)\n[^2]: [GitHub's Arctic Vault](https://archiveprogram.github.com/)\n[^3]: [BentoML](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML)","lastmodified":"2022-02-15T20:23:08.88547976Z","title":"A case for funding Open Source"},"/posts/play":{"content":"---\n\n*Extension of my thoughts about [play](thoughts/play.md) and discussions from our [Interact Circle](thoughts/Interact%20Circle%20W21.md) on [Hackathon Culture](posts/hackathons.md) and Play.*\n\n## Defining play\nI've spent a lot of the past few months reminiscing on the childhood days of finding funny looking patterns in the rocks in my backyard and building LEGOs without instruction manuals.\n\nI've spent so much time thinking about how to ['bring back play'](posts/hackathons.md), yet not a lot of thinking about *what play is*. The more I think about it, the more nebulous it feels to define. I know examples of it when I see it -- the building of blanket forts during sleepovers, the joy of beating Minecraft for the first time with your friends -- but to put words to it feels difficult.\n\nThe most intuitive definition is one that comes from Bill Watterson: play is anything that you do on your own volition or agency just for its own sake. It is an *intrinsically* motivated activity.\n\n![](/posts/images/play/agency.png)\n\nPlay is the act of enjoying the process, the means to the end. To have as much fun as possible along the way. Quoting [Kernel](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-1/joyful-subversion), to \"turn life into a canvas, rather than a graph with checkpoints\".\n\nYet this definition still seems inadequate. What separates work from play? Are they mutually exclusive? What about those who cannot afford time out of their day to do anything *but work*? Those who play games professionally?\n\nHere, I turn to Jenny Odell's [*How to Do Nothing*](thoughts/How%20to%20do%20Nothing.md) and Bernard Herbert Suit's [*The Grasshopper: Games, Life, and Utopia*](thoughts/The%20Grasshopper.md) to further explore this definition.\n\n## How to Do Nothing\nOdell’s book *How to Do Nothing* focuses on resisting the current attention economy. Doing ‘nothing’ within a productivity-obsessed environment can, in fact, help to restore communities, both locally and beyond.\n\n'Nothing', in this case, refers not to actually doing nothing but rather to not participating in the [attention economy](thoughts/attention%20economy.md) and hustle culture. 'Nothing' means doing nothing productive.\n\nRecently, I have been grappling with the question of whether self-care is [selfish](thoughts/selfish.md). My inner self wants to be able to do nothing: just do projects I find fun, hang out with my friends, and go outside. However, I know that *long term*, working hard at doing well at my job and in school will do me more good, career-wise.\n\n![](/posts/images/play/long-term.png)\n\nHow can I justify setting aside time to do nothing when I have so many people asking for my time and pulling me in so many directions? In the attention economy, attention is scarce. \n\nPlay allows us to create environments where saying 'no' is okay. By definition, nobody forces you to play. **Play is what allows us to create local spaces of abundance.**\n\n\u003e \"Caring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self preservation, and that is an act of political warfare.\"\n\nPlay is the catalyst that will enable the post-attention-economy society. But what do we do when we get there?\n\n## The Grasshopper\n*Of all the things you could do in utopia, why would one play games?*\n\n*The Grasshopper* was a book unlike any I've ever read before. A talking grasshopper and his insect disciples convinced me, through [Socratic dialogue](https://www.thoughtco.com/socratic-dialogue-argumentation-1691972) nonetheless, that \"refusing to work and insisting upon devoting himself exclusively to play\" is a perfectly acceptable thing to embody.\n\nWhereas Odell focused on how to get to a post-work society, Suit's approach to play and games focuses on what to do *in* a post-work society. A utopia of doing absolutely nothing feels dreadfully boring. What is there left to do? To play games, obviously!\n\nWhen I say 'game', I don’t just mean chess, basketball, or a video game. I mean a more holistic one that includes climbing mountains, the pursuit of knowledge, and the creation of art itself.\n\nGames, as Suits defines it, are \"goal-directed activities in which inefficient means are intentionally chosen.\" In games, one *purposefully* ignores the more efficient method. To play a game is to do the crossword puzzle *without* looking up the answers, even though looking it up would be the most efficient way of finishing the crossword.

Let us explore this argument through a Socratic dialogue.","lastmodified":"2022-02-15T20:23:08.88547976Z","title":"Play to Win: A Post-Work Society"},"/posts/react":{"content":"React is, as the [website](https://reactjs.org/) says, \"a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.\" What this means exactly, is often confusing to people.\n\nMany articles claim to teach you \"React in 10 minutes\" but rarely go beyond a few code examples. The problem is that this leaves you with an inkling of what React looks like and maybe how to write a bit of it, but no clue *why* it works and how to think about fixing React bugs.\n\nThis isn’t some random tutorial which throws you a bunch of example code that you go on to copy-and-paste and then leaves you hanging wondering what it does. The goal of the workshop is to give attendees a good foundation of the concepts within React, why people choose to use React, and how it works behind the hood. Hopefully, this gives you a good enough foundation to hit the ground running and avoid entire classes of bugs when starting out in React!\n\nThis post assumes that you know basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\n\n## What is React?\nThe TLDR; is that it's a bunch of code you can add to your project that makes building websites and interfaces that **react** to changes when you do things (e.g. press buttons) really easy.\n\nReact has two distinguishing features that set it apart:\n1. React is **declarative** meaning you tell React exactly what you want the page to look like and it'll figure out how to do that.\n2. React is **component based** meaning that you can create pieces of the UI that you can reuse across different parts of your application.\n\n## How a website works\nMost likely, you've written some code for a website in plain old HTML before. This, as you know, defines the structure for what is inside a webpage. If the webpage is a house, the HTML is the blueprint that tells you what the house should generally look like and what is inside.\n\nYet, to turn that bunch of HTML into something displayable in your web browser, it needs to parse it into a more intermediate format it can more easily work with: the Document Object Model (DOM).\n\nThe nested structure of the HTML lends itself very well to a tree-like structure which the browser can then efficiently traverse and make updates to.\n\n![Turning HTML into the DOM and then into the actual site](/posts/images/react/html-dom-site.png)*Turning HTML into the DOM and then into the actual site*\n\n## How React works\n### The Virtual DOM\nOf course, you can still manipulate and interact with the regular DOM [through JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction) still but the main gripe that React has with this way of manipulating the DOM (e.g. adding new things to the screen or modifying existing bits on the page) is that it can be *realllyyy* slow in some cases.\n\nThis is where the mystical **virtual DOM** comes in. Modifying the DOM in a declarative way is difficult because modifying the real DOM is imperative by nature, making it difficult to write declarative applications. You could use `element.innerHTML = 'your html'` in a declarative fashion, but an in-memory version implemented in JavaScript would be faster than using `innerHTML`, which is exactly exactly what React does. React creates a virtual DOM where it keeps track of what it would *like* the real DOM to look like and then intelligently batches and combines changes together to optimize and squeeze the most performance out of the few expensive writes to the real DOM that it actually does. More info on [how DOM diffing and patching works](https://buildwithreact.com/tutorial/under-the-hood) under the hood for those curious.\n\n\u003e Please note that Virtual DOM is not faster than raw, imperative operations on the real DOM (best performance). React uses the Virtual DOM because it is a relatively efficient way of declaratively representing your UI from state, and much faster compared to straight `innerHTML` calls.\n\n![React's Virtual DOM in action. ReactDOM.render() tells React to attach your React components to the real DOM](/posts/images/react/virtual-DOM.png)*React's Virtual DOM in action. ReactDOM.render() tells React to attach your React components to the real DOM*\n\n### Components\nAnother things that React tackles really well is that regular HTML and JS makes it a lot more difficult than it should be to re-use the same UI and logic across different pages on your website.\n\n![What if you wanted to reuse this 'product card' component?](/posts/images/react/component-reuse.png)*What if you wanted to reuse this 'product card' component?*\n\nThe main philosophy of functional React is that you shouldn't override and inherit behaviour. Instead, get the behaviour you want by creating and composing reusable *components*. Each of these components can hold some sort of data of its own, called its **state**. Each component can also take in a few arguments or parameters called **properties** or **props** for short. Each component is composed up of either primative HTML elements (e.g. `\u003cdiv\u003e` or `\u003ch1\u003e`) or other React components. The elements that a component is made up of are called its **children**.\n\n![React Component Diagram](/posts/images/react/component-diagram.png)*React Component Diagram*\n\nBecause React uses composition to build components, there is a natural *downward flow of information*, where components pass data to their children. Thus, to change a parent's state, the parent needs to explicitly pass a callback function that allows that behaviour to the child (e.g. an arrow function that wraps the `setState` function for the parent). This is detailed more in the 'Building an App section'.\n\n### JSX\nJSX is a extension to regular JS which lets you write HTML-like code to define React components. It is declarative at heart, meaning you describe exactly what you want the component to look like based off of some given data (props and state in this case) and React will figure out how to get the page to look like that.\n\nJSX can be just regular HTML.\n\n```jsx\n\u003cdiv\u003eBottom Text\u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\nIt can also be a user-defined component. In this case, the component has no children or 'inner HTML' so we can write its shorthand.\n\n```jsx\n\u003cExampleComponent/\u003e\n```\n\nWe can also pass in properties to a component by adding a tag with that property name. Any string can be passed in regularly, or you can also choose to pass in any JS expression (e.g. number, function, object, etc.) by enclosing it in curly braces.\n\n```jsx\n\u003cHello name=\"World\" someData={2 + 3}/\u003e\n```\n\nTo 'compose' components, you can nest them as children within each other.\n\n```jsx\n\u003cDashboard\u003e\n  \u003cGreeting/\u003e\n  \u003cStatistics\u003e\n    \u003cBarChart data={data}/\u003e\n    \u003cPieChart data={data}/\u003e\n  \u003c/Statistics\u003e\n\u003c/Dashboard\u003e\n```\n\nGreat, so that's just what JSX *looks like*, how do we use it in React? The first thing to note is that a **component in React is defined as a function which returns some JSX**.\n\nHere's a simple 'Hello World' component in React! We then write a return statement that defines exactly how to render this component (i.e. what children make up this component).\n\nNote that React passes us all of the props from the parent in a 'props' object. Then, in the return statement's JSX, we can then access the name property by using `{}` to indicate a JS expression and accessing the 'name' field in the `props` object.\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react'\n\nfunction Greeting(props) {\n  return \u003cp\u003eHello {props.name}!\u003c/p\u003e\n}\n```\n\nLet's say we want to create a `\u003cHelloWorld/\u003e` component that re-uses our `\u003cGreeting/\u003e` component from above.\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react'\n\nfunction HelloWorld() {\n  return \u003cdiv\u003e\n    \u003ch1\u003eMy Hello World App\u003c/h1\u003e\n    \u003cGreeting name=\"World!\"/\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n}\n```\n\nThen, at the end, we tell React to finally render our `\u003cHelloWorld/\u003e` component into the actual DOM by using `ReactDOM.render(...)`. Here, we choose to replace the element with the id 'root' in the real DOM with our `\u003cHelloWorld/\u003e` component.\n\n```jsx\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom'\n\nReactDOM.render(HelloWorld, document.getElementById('root'))\n```\n\n## Life Cycle\nSo far we've covered static components using just plain old JSX and data passing using props, but this misses the biggest benefit that React offers: reactivity to data changes. We'll look a little at the life cycle of React components to see where we can update a component when data changes.\n\nThere are three main parts to the life cycle to a React component. They are mounted, updated, and eventually unmounted.\n\n![React Component Lifecycle](/posts/images/react/lifecycle.png)*React Component Lifecycle*\n\n### Mount\nMounting happens when the component is first added to the virtual DOM. Here, we set the initial state of the component (e.g. to track the number of clicks, a user's input, etc.) and tell React to update the DOM.\n\n### Update\nAn update happens when its parent component is updated or when its state or props changes. Here, we can modify the state of the component, do asyncronous things (like call an API), and rerender the component.\n\n### Unmount\nThe unmount happens when the parent component is no longer rendered to the DOM. Now, we cleanup anything that needs to be cleaned up, destroying all state, and removing the component from the DOM.\n\n## Hooks\nNote that when a component updates, React will call the component again with the new props thus **clearing all local state**. This is why you can't just declare a new `const` inside a component for state. Introducing: hooks! They are JavaScript functions that allow us to 'hook' into the React lifecycle and do things like fetch data and persist state.\n\n### useState\nLet's say we want to track how many times a user has clicked a button. A naive implementation might look something like this, where we define a variable in the scope of the component.\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react'\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  let count = 0\n\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003eYou clicked {count} times\u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003cbutton onClick={() =\u003e count++}\u003e\n        Increment\n      \u003c/button\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this will not work! Because React doesn't know about the count variable, incrementing it will not update the component and thus not re-render it onto the screen. To register a component's state with React, we use the `useState` hook.\n\nThis will allow React to preserve the state between re-renders. `useState` returns a pair: a read-only variable representing the _current_ state value and a function that lets you set a new value for the state.\n\nThe first parameter to the `useState` hook is the default value that React should assign to the state when the component is first mounted.\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { useState } from 'react'\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  // Declare a new state variable called count initialized to 0\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n\n  // When the button is clicked, update the count to be\n  // the previous count + 1\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003eYou clicked {count} times\u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003cbutton onClick={() =\u003e setCount(count + 1)}\u003e\n        Increment\n      \u003c/button\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nNow when the button is clicked, the count is then incremented by one. Because we used the `useState` hook, React knows about this component state and will then known to re-render the component when the state is updated.\n\nNote that you **cannot** directly modify the `count` variable because it is read-only. If you want to mutate it, use the `setCount` function that is returned from the hook.\n\n#### A note about syntax\nBecause this is just using JavaScript's [destructuring assignment syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment), we can call the variable whatever we want.\n\n```jsx\nconst [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n\n// is equivalent to\n\nconst state = useState(0) // state is an array of length 2\nconst count = state[0]\nconst setCount = state[1]\n```\n\n### useEffect\nAsynchronous data fetching, manually changing the window title, and setting recurring events are all examples of side effects. Yet, React won't let us do that right now because we have no way to do things in between the mount and unmount lifecycle events.\n\nIntroducing the `useEffect` hook, which lets us peform side effects within components.\n\nLet's consider the previous example of keeping track of amount of times the user has clicked a button. What if we want to set the window title to be the number of times the button has been clicked so far?\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n\n  // setup a new effect that runs everytime `count` is updated\n  // this will re-render the component too\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    document.title = `${count} clicks`\n  }, [count])\n\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003eYou clicked {count} times\u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003cbutton onClick={() =\u003e setCount(count + 1)}\u003e\n        Increment\n      \u003c/button\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\n`useEffect` doesn't return anything, but takes two parameters. The first is the callback which is the effect we want to run, this callback takes 0 parameters. The second parameter is the array of dependencies for the effect. React uses this array to determine when to re-run our effect (you can optionally omit this entire array to re-run the effect *every* time the component updates).\n\n### useSWR\nWhat about making API requests to fetch user data or data from an external third-party? While technically you can do this with `useEffect` and `useState`, it gets messy really quickly.\n\nThis hook isn't an official React one, but I use it so much in my projects that it might as well be. Introducing `useSWR`, a [hook from Vercel](https://swr.vercel.app/) that lets you make asynchronous HTTP requests extremely easily.\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react'\nimport useSWR from 'swr'\n\n// a function that performs an http request and returns a response\n// this can be reused across all of your requests\nconst fetcher = url =\u003e fetch(url).then(res =\u003e res.json())\n\nfunction Profile() {\n  // example HTTP GET request to /api/user\n  const { data, error } = useSWR('/api/user', fetcher)\n\n  // we can use conditional rendering to display\n  // error or loading messages\n  if (error) return \u003cdiv\u003efailed to load\u003c/div\u003e\n  if (!data) return \u003cdiv\u003eloading...\u003c/div\u003e\n\n  // if the code reaches this point, we know\n  // that our request will have finished and have no errors!\n  return \u003cdiv\u003eHello {data.name}!\u003c/div\u003e\n}\n```\n\n### Order matters\nOne really common beginner mistake that I made a lot when first starting out is that **hooks need to be called in the exact same order every time.** This means that you can't have hooks after any conditional returns, inside `if` statements, or inside function/callback definitions.\n\n```jsx\n// DON'T: conditionally run hook\nif (someCondition) {\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    // run effect here\n  })\n}\n\n// DO: put conditional inside the hook\nuseEffect(() =\u003e {\n  if (someCondition) {\n    // run effect here\n  }\n})\n```\n\nFor more information, read the [official React docs on this](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html#only-call-hooks-at-the-top-level).\n\n## Building an App\nGreat, so now you have all this theory. You're probably itching to build something and that's exactly what this section is for! We'll be building a very basic **todo application** where you can add and remove from the list. For this bit, a basic understanding of [Git and GitHub](https://resources.nwplus.io/2-beginner/how-to-git-github.html) is required.\n\nFirst, make you install a version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) `\u003e= 12.x`. If you are unsure, you can check your Node version by doing `node -v`.\n\n```bash\n$ node -v\nv12.14.0 # good to go!\n```\n\n### Starter Code\nNormally, most people will tell you to run `create-react-app` here to create a new React application, but I find that `create-react-app` has way too much boilerplate (extra code) for my taste so I made my own more stripped down version of `create-react-app`. It contains everything you need to get started with a new React app and, in my opinion, is a lot less confusing.\n\nTo get started open your terminal of choice and clone this [minimal React template](https://github.com/jackyzha0/min-react). This will give you all the code you need to get started!\n\n```bash\n# clone the repository\n$ git clone https://github.com/jackyzha0/min-react.git\n\n# navigate to folder\n$ cd min-react\n\n# install dependencies\n$ npm i\n\n# run local dev server! (open localhost:3000 in your browser)\n$ npm run start\n```\n\nThen, let's remove some of the starter files we don't need. Delete the `src/components` folder. We'll be working `src/App.js` for the rest of this tutorial.\n\n### Creating the App component\nLet's delete what's in `src/App.js` and start fresh. What do we need in our todo app? Well, we need to track the list of todos the user has. Let's create a state for that and initialize it with a few default todos. Then, the component should just be a container for all of our todo items. We can just map over the `todos` state and turn them into `\u003cTodoItem\u003e` components!\n\nWe can keep the styling from the template just so it looks a bit nicer.\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { useState } from 'react'\nimport styled from 'styled-components'\n\n// custom styling using styled-components!\nconst AppContainer = styled.div`\n margin: 40vh 30vw;\n`\n\nfunction App() {\n  // setup todos\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([\"do laundry\", \"finish homework\"])\n\n  // app is composed up of all the current todos\n  return (\n    \u003cAppContainer\u003e\n      \u003ch1\u003etodos\u003c/h1\u003e\n      {todos.map((item, i) =\u003e \u003cTodoItem\n        key={i}\n        name={item}\n      /\u003e)}\n    \u003c/AppContainer\u003e\n  )\n}\n\nexport default App\n```\n\nThe problem is, we don't have a `\u003cTodoItem\u003e` component yet. Let's make it!\n\n### Creating a Todo component (Component Styling)\nWe need a component to display each of our todo items. The only prop we really need is the name of the todo to display it so we'll make a simple component; no need to track state or anything.\n\n```jsx\nfunction TodoItem(props) {\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003e{props.name}\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nLet's add a hover state so that the item has a strikethrough effect when you hover over it. We can do this using `styled-components` which is a way for us to add CSS to our components really easily.\n\n```jsx\n// create a 'styled' div that has a strikethrough on hover\nconst TodoItemContainer = styled.div`\n  \u0026:hover \u003e p {\n    text-decoration: line-through;\n  }\n`\n\nfunction TodoItem(props) {\n  // replace the original div with the `TodoItemContainer`\n  // styled div we just created\n  return (\n    \u003cTodoItemContainer\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003e{props.name}\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003c/TodoItemContainer\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nGreat! Now let's see what that looks like.\n\n![Our todo app with a strikethrough effect!](/posts/images/react/todo-0.png)*Our todo app with a strikethrough effect!*\n\n### Deleting a Todo (Passing callbacks)\nHmm, would be great if we could actually delete a todo by just clicking on a todo item. Good thing [React has event handlers](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html) just like regular HTML elements do! Let's modify our `\u003cTodoItem\u003e` to handle a click event. To do that, we just pass a callback to the the desired component using the `onClick` prop.\n\n```jsx\nfunction TodoItem(props) {\n  return (\n    \u003cTodoItemContainer\n      onClick={() =\u003e {\n        alert(`You finished ${props.name}!`)\n      }}\n    \u003e\n      \u003cp\u003e{props.name}\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003c/TodoItemContainer\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nNow, when we click each todo item, our page will give us an alert saying we completed that item! Not super useful though. Can we just delete the item from the component?\n\nRecall from earlier that with React, information flows *downward* in the component hierarchy tree. This means that in order to modify the state of the parent (`\u003cApp\u003e` in this case), we need to pass a callback that helps us modify the information.\n\nTo do that, we create a `deleteTodo` function in `\u003cApp\u003e` and then pass an anonymous function to each todo which deletes that given todo. Note that because we can't directly modify the `todos` variable as it is read-only, we create a copy of it using the spread syntax (`[...todos]`), then remove a single element by index using splice.\n\n```jsx\nfunction App() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([\"do laundry\", \"finish homework\"])\n\n  // callback to remove a todo\n  const deleteTodo = (index) =\u003e {\n    // copy current todos\n    const newTodos = [...todos]\n    // remove todo at given index\n    newTodos.splice(index, 1)\n    setTodos(newTodos)\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \u003cAppContainer\u003e\n      \u003ch1\u003etodos\u003c/h1\u003e\n      {todos.map((item, i) =\u003e \u003cTodoItem\n        key={i}\n        name={item}\n        deleteCallback={() =\u003e deleteTodo(i)}\n      /\u003e)}\n    \u003c/AppContainer\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThen, we update `\u003cTodoItem\u003e` to use this callback on click.\n\n```jsx\nfunction TodoItem(props) {\n  return (\n    \u003cTodoItemContainer onClick={props.deleteCallback}\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003e{props.name}\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003c/TodoItemContainer\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nGreat, so now we have display and deletion. Adding new todos is up next!\n\n### Adding a Todo (Form Inputs)\nFirst, let's create a short form component that will allow us to accept user input. Let's setup a state field for the user input and create a form with a single text input. To update the state of the component as the user types, we attach an `onChange` event handler to the `\u003cinput\u003e` which sets the value of the `todo` state to whatever the input field is.\n\n```jsx\nfunction TodoForm(props) {\n  // form state\n  const [todo, setTodo] = useState(\"\")\n\n  return (\n    \u003cform\u003e\n      \u003cinput\n        type=\"text\"\n        value={todo}\n        onChange={e =\u003e setTodo(e.target.value)}\n      /\u003e\n    \u003c/form\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nNow, let's handle what happens when the user submits this form (i.e. presses enter). We add an `onSubmit` handler to the form to handle this. Note that we specifically tell the browser to *not* refresh the page (which is the default behaviour for a form submission) and clear the form state.\n\nBy telling React that the value of the `\u003cinput\u003e` is equal to the component state `todo`, React knows that this is a [controlled component](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components), meaning that the component state is the **single source of truth** here.\n\n```jsx\nfunction TodoForm(props) {\n  const [todo, setTodo] = useState(\"\")\n\n  const handleSubmit = (e) =\u003e {\n    // prevent form from refreshing page\n    e.preventDefault()\n\n    // show an alert with user input\n    alert(todo)\n\n    // clear form\n    setTodo(\"\")\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \u003cform onSubmit={handleSubmit}\u003e\n      \u003cinput\n        type=\"text\"\n        value={todo}\n        onChange={e =\u003e setTodo(e.target.value)}\n      /\u003e\n    \u003c/form\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nLet's add a bit of styling to make the text box not as ugly and add `\u003cTodoForm\u003e` to the end of the todos list so it actually gets rendered.\n\n```jsx\nconst TodoInput = styled.input`\n padding: 0.7em 0.5em;\n border: 1px solid black;\n border-radius: 4px;\n`\n\nfunction TodoForm(props) {\n  const [todo, setTodo] = useState(\"\")\n\n  const handleSubmit = (e) =\u003e {\n    // prevent form from refreshing page\n    e.preventDefault()\n\n    // show an alert with user input\n    alert(todo)\n\n    // clear form\n    setTodo(\"\")\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \u003cform onSubmit={handleSubmit}\u003e\n      \u003cTodoInput\n        type=\"text\"\n        placeholder=\"Add a new todo...\"\n        value={todo}\n        onChange={e =\u003e setTodo(e.target.value)}\n      /\u003e\n    \u003c/form\u003e\n  )\n}\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([\"do laundry\", \"finish homework\"])\n\n  const deleteTodo = (index) =\u003e {\n    const newTodos = [...todos]\n    newTodos.splice(index, 1)\n    setTodos(newTodos)\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \u003cAppContainer\u003e\n      \u003ch1\u003etodos\u003c/h1\u003e\n      {todos.map((item, i) =\u003e \u003cTodoItem\n        key={i}\n        name={item}\n        deleteCallback={() =\u003e deleteTodo(i)}\n      /\u003e)}\n      \u003cTodoForm/\u003e\n    \u003c/AppContainer\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nLooking snazzy!\n\n![A nice new 'Add Todo' field!](/posts/images/react/todo-1.png)*A nice new 'Add Todo' field!*\n\nFinally, let's link this up back to the main `\u003cApp\u003e` state so that adding a new todo actually modifies the state of the app. We create a `addTodo` callback and pass this to the `\u003cTodoForm\u003e` component through using a `addCallback` prop.\n\n```jsx\nfunction TodoForm(props) {\n  const [todo, setTodo] = useState(\"\")\n\n  const handleSubmit = (e) =\u003e {\n    e.preventDefault()\n    // use the provided 'addCallback' prop\n    props.addCallback(todo)\n    setTodo(\"\")\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \u003cform onSubmit={handleSubmit}\u003e\n      \u003cTodoInput\n        type=\"text\"\n        placeholder=\"Add a new todo...\"\n        value={todo}\n        onChange={e =\u003e setTodo(e.target.value)}\n      /\u003e\n    \u003c/form\u003e\n  )\n}\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([\"do laundry\", \"finish homework\"])\n\n  const deleteTodo = (index) =\u003e {\n    const newTodos = [...todos]\n    newTodos.splice(index, 1)\n    setTodos(newTodos)\n  }\n\n  // callback to add a new todo\n  const addTodo = (todo) =\u003e {\n    const newTodos = [...todos, todo]\n    setTodos(newTodos)\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \u003cAppContainer\u003e\n      \u003ch1\u003etodos\u003c/h1\u003e\n      {todos.map((item, i) =\u003e \u003cTodoItem\n        key={i}\n        name={item}\n        deleteCallback={() =\u003e deleteTodo(i)}\n      /\u003e)}\n      \u003cTodoForm addCallback={addTodo} /\u003e\n    \u003c/AppContainer\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### Finished App\nAnd with that, you've finished your first React application!

Part 1 will touch on defining the problem we’re trying to solve, the data we have, and how we pre-processed it. Part 2 will focus on the architecture of the model we built, how well it does, and thoughts on improving it for the future.\n\n## The problem\n\nClassifying intents is at the core of reflect. When a user inputs an intent, its reflect’s job to figure out whether that intent should let them into the website.\n\n\u003e How do we make sure “do some marketing work for reflect” is classified as productive but “watch cute dog videos” isn’t?\n\n## Why it’s so difficult\n\nA lot of it comes down to the fact that natural language processing (NLP) is a very difficult task. What does the sentence “learn about physics” mean, and how is it semantically different from “asdflkj I can’t do work”?\n\nWe can’t just parse for keywords and just allow a user in if we see the word “work” because that word can mean different things in different contexts. For example, “I’m not doing any work right now” would have otherwise been classified as valid. Thus, we can employ the help of a machine learning algorithm to help us capture this deeper meaning.\n\nSpecifically, the form of machine learning we will be using is called **supervised learning,** in which we give an algorithm a bunch of labelled data, tell it what it’s doing wrong, and let it ‘learn.’ Through doing this, hopefully the algorithm will be able to generalize and make predictions on unseen data too.\n\n## The data\n\nOf course, if we want to perform supervised learning, we’re going to need a lot of data. Where are we going to get all of it? Luckily, we were able to get it through 3 different sources.\n\n### Survey data (444 entries)\n\nOur team sent out an interest survey in early January in which we asked 3 questions:\n\n1. How would you answer if you were trying to visit a distracting site while trying to focus? (eg. youtube, facebook, etc)\n\n1. How would you answer if you were trying to visit a distracting site to take a quick break from your work? (eg. youtube, facebook, etc)\n\n1. How would you answer if you were trying to visit a distracting site like Facebook but to do work? (e.g. make a marketing post)\n\nWe used these answers to form the basis of our very first dataset. We ended up getting a surprising amount of entries, ending with 148 responses to 3 questions and totalling 444 different observations. Here’s what some of that data looks like after tidying it up:\n\n\u003e We classified any answer to Q1 as invalid and Q2 + Q3 as valid\n\n\n| intent | valid |\n|-|-|\n| I am watching a 5 minute video to take my mind off not being productive :/ | no |\n| I'm just bored | no |\n| I’m bored/tired and trying to relax | no |\n| ... | ... |\n| work is pretty boring, i need to take a quick break I just can't focus atm | yes |\n| I finished all my work for today so I'm going to take a break now! | yes |\n| getting some advertising done for my club | yes |\n| I need to make a post on Twitter for my job announcing the latest update to our site | yes |\n| I'm trying to network | yes |\n| ... | ... |\n\n\n### Closed Beta (790 entries)\n\nAfter we made a basic dataset, we were able to make our first (admittedly not great) model. But in doing so, this let us create an MVP to which we could use to actually test with. We then deployed this model for use to our closed beta testers and collected their responses (with consent of course!) along with the website it was input on. This was then converted into a .csv file. A few examples are show below:\n\n| intent | url |\n|-|-|\n| to do some marketing | facebook.com/ |\n| i cannot focus on my work | instagram.com/ |\n| fuel my crippling social media addiction | facebook.com/ |\n| ... | ... |\n\nThese were then hand-labelled by our reflect team in a similar format as the survey data we collected earlier.\n\n| intent | valid |\n|-|-|\n| to do some marketing | yes |\n| i cannot focus on my work | no |\n| fuel my crippling social media addiction | no |\n| ... | ... |\n\n### Closed Beta Corrections (37 entries)\n\nFinally, we created a Google Forms through which we directly asked beta testers if a decision made by reflect’s intent classifier was faulty. Specifically, we asked what they input, and what they expected. Here are a few examples:\n\n\n| input | valid |\n|-|-|\n| reply to a friend about a lab | yes |\n| listening to a youtube music playlist | yes |\n| goof off as much as possible | yes |\n|...|...|\n\n\nThis entire section of the dataset was only 37 observations, but it drastically helped us reduce false positives and false negatives by focusing specifically on misclassifications.\n\nAfter aggregating and combing all our data into one common format, we ended up with a grand total of 1271 observations. They looked something like this:\n\n\n| input | expected |\n|-|-|\n| fail school by watching youtube | no |\n| sdlkjasd | no |\n| making a quick product post (should take \u003c10 min) | yes |\n| ... | ... |\n\n\n### So?\n\nNow that we have the data, can we just throw it into a machine learning model? Unfortunately, the answer is no, not quite yet.\n\n## Data augmentation\n\nOur dataset is still pretty small, even after aggregating all of our data. It most definitely doesn’t cover all of our bases for all the possible things that future users could possibly input. So, how can we “upsample” our data to get more of it? Well, it turns out that the field of Natural Language Processing has quite a few tricks to augment our data.\n\n### Sentence Variation\n\nEssentially what sentence variation is, is just replacing a few words of given sentences with their synonyms. If we have a sentence like “I’m trying to make a marketing post,” we can swap out singular words with their synonyms and tell our network that it means the same thing.\n\nIn this example, we could get something like “I’m attempting to fabricate a marketing post”. Adding these additional sentence variations will allow our machine learning model to learn semantic relationships between similar words (e.g. fabricate and make have similar meaning)\n\n### Sentence Negation\n\nAdditionally, if we add a ‘not’ in the sentence, it should flip the meaning of the sentence. An example would be “learning about physics” is valid, whereas “not learning about physics” is not. However, if the sentence already contains ‘not’ (e.g. “I’m not being productive”), adding another ‘not’ would make the sentence too complex and obfuscated, so we just label it as invalid. In essence, we just add ‘not’ to a bunch of sentences and label them as invalid. This helps us to combat intents which use negations in a sort of round-a-bout way to confuse the algorithm.\n\n### Shuffled Sentences\n\nIf we take an existing, valid sentence and completely shuffle the words, the resulting sentence should be invalid. An example would be “to watch a crash course video*” should be valid whereas “video course a watch crash to*” should be invalid. Basically, we’re just shuffling existing sentences and also labelling them as invalid. This helps us to combat intents which grammatically make no sense, but are otherwise valid.\n\n### Garbage Sentences\n\nWe can also take completely random words from the English language and put them together. The resulting sentences should all be invalid. For example, “*untinkered phalangitis shaly quinovic dish spadiciflorous unshaved” *clearly makes no sense. However, the addition of these gibberish sentences allows our model to be more robust against foreign words and out-of-vocabulary terms.\n\n### Vocabulary-mix Sentences\n\nLast but definitely not least, we can take the most common words in our dataset and mash them together. This should yield us a bunch of sentences which contain “key words” but should be marked as invalid because the context in which they are used makes no sense. For example, “video look watching” and “get research facebook take need want need message watch” are both clearly gibberish sentences, but they have a lot of keywords that one would think would let you in (e.g. video, research, watching, etc.). This lets us be more robust against those who try to get around the algorithm using keywords.\n\n## Data preprocessing\n\nWhat about now? Can we throw it into the neural network yet? Well, no. We may have increased the amount of data we have to work with, but we also need to convert it to a form that is easy to understand for both the computer and for our algorithm. We do that with a series of functions that we apply on our data.\n\n### Strip punctuation\n\nAs the name suggests, we remove all punctuation from the input phrase. We found that including the punctuation hurt our performance, most likely due to the fact that they offer very little in terms of semantic meaning and obfuscate the real meaning of the sentence.\n\n```python\nstripPunctuation(\"I don't know if I'm being productive! :(\") \n\u003e \"I dont know if Im being productive\"\n```\n\n### Make everything lowercase\n\nAdditionally, we found that in this particular setting, capital letters also didn’t matter that much. Because of the nature we collect our data (just a simple textbox), users tend to not bother with capitalization. As such, we remove it to make it consistent across our data.\n\n```python\nlower(\"I dont know if Im being productive\")\n\u003e \"i dont know if im being productive\"\n```\n\n### Expand contractions\n\nThe English language does this weird thing where we can just smush two words together (e.g. “I am” to “I’m”). Unfortunately for us, these produce extra complexity in our model that we could reduce by making them all consistent. In our case, we chose to expand all of these contractions.\n\n```python\nexpandContractions(\"i dont know if im being productive\") \n\u003e \"i do not know if i am being productive\"\n```\n\n### Remove stop words\n\nThe English language also has a bunch of these things called **stop words** — words that do not contribute anything major to the sentence in terms of semantic understanding (usually in the context of natural language tasks such as this). A few examples of them are ‘I’, ‘me’, ‘my’, ‘by’, and ‘on’. By removing them, we once again remove unneeded complexity from the model.\n\n```python\nrmStopwords(\"i do not know if i am being productive\") \n\u003e \"not know productive\"\n```\n\n### Tokenization\n\nHowever, these words are not super friendly for machine learning algorithms who would much rather deal with integers and floating point numbers than words and sentences. How do we fix this?\n\nWell, one thing we can do is turn words in indices by how often they appear, capped at the most common 1000 words — in essence, creating a vocabulary list mapping common words to numbers. For example, if “the” is the most common word, we convert it to 1. If “work” is the 8th most common word, we convert it to 8. For anything that isn’t in the top 1000, we give it the value of 0.\n\n```python\ntokenize(\"not know productive\") \n\u003e [12, 35, 7]\n```\n\n### Fixed sequence length\n\nFinally, we need to ensure that all the inputs are the same length of simplicity sake. If we were to handle dynamic length inputs, it would introduce a whole other level of complexity that we’re really not ready to deal with. As such, we can make sure all the inputs are the same length by adding a bunch of zeros to those who are too short (zero padding) or by slicing those who are too long.\n\n```python\npad([12, 35, 7], 10) \n\u003e [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 12, 35, 7]\n```\n\n### Finally\n\nAfter all of these functions have been applied, we have successfully converted a complex sentence into a series of ‘tokens’ that is easy to understand for the machine learning algorithm.\n\n```python\npreprocess(\"I don’t know if I’m being productive! :(\")\n\u003e [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 12, 35, 7]\n```\n\n## What’s next?\n\nNow that we have something ready to feed into our neural network, let’s dive into how the actual model itself works! How do we tell that this is a “valid” intent?\n\n## The model\n\nThe type of neural network that we’ll be using is called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).\n\n![credit: Christopher Olah, 2015](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4000/0*HyoZq6fOfsnn2YOC)*credit: Christopher Olah, 2015*\n\nWhat’s so special about these networks is that they are really good at modelling time-series data, making it an ideal candidate for tasks like forecasting or natural language processing.\n\n```python\n# Function to create a RNN model with given parameters\n# max_seq_len: maximum token sequence length\n# vocab_size:  size of tokenizer vocabulary\ndef RNN(max_seq_len, vocab_size):\n    inputs = Input(name='inputs', shape=[max_seq_len])\n    layer = Embedding(vocab_size, 64, input_length=max_seq_len)(inputs)\n    layer = LSTM(64, return_sequences = True)(layer)\n    layer = Dropout(0.5)(layer)\n    layer = LSTM(64)(layer)\n    layer = Dense(256, name='FC1')(layer)\n    layer = Dropout(0.5)(layer)\n    layer = Dense(1, name='out_layer')(layer)\n    layer = Activation('sigmoid')(layer)\n    model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=layer)\n    return model\n```\n\nHere’s how we define it in our [Keras code](https://github.com/jackyzha0/reflect-nlp/blob/master/nlp/net.py), don’t worry if you don’t understand it just yet! We’ll explain it in the next few paragraphs.\n\n```python\ninputs = Input(name='inputs', shape=[max_seq_len])\n```\n\nRight off the bat, you’ll notice that the first layer is the Input layer. Basically, this tells Keras to instantiate a new tensor (a multi-dimensional vector) with a given shape. In this case, we’re creating a one-dimensional tensor that is max_seq_len units long. When we trained our model, this was set to 75.\n\n```python\nlayer = Embedding(vocab_size, 64, input_length=max_seq_len)(inputs)\n```\n\nNext up, we have the Embedding layer. We could get into a really technical discussion about what this really does, but you can think of it as a layer that helps the neural network to learn semantic relationships between inputs.\n\n![credit: Rutger Ruizendaal, 2017](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3010/0*YOZ_CfmtgpUbJ9BD)*credit: Rutger Ruizendaal, 2017*\n\nEssentially, it embeds tokens in a higher dimension vector space, where distance between tokens represents its similarity.\n\n```python\nlayer = LSTM(64, return_sequences = True)(layer)\n```\n\nNow, we get into the meat of the neural network: the LSTM layer. As stated before, these LSTM networks are really good at modelling time series data like language. In this case, our LSTM network has 64 hidden units per cell, and that we’d like to pass these hidden states to the next layer. If you’d like to learn more about the inner workings of the LSTM model, theres a really good resource [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/illustrated-guide-to-lstms-and-gru-s-a-step-by-step-explanation-44e9eb85bf21)!\n\n```python\nlayer = Dropout(0.5)(layer)\n```\n\nNext, you’ll notice there are a few Dropout layers. These layers help to prevent overfitting by randomly killing off connections between the two layers (a sort of regularization). This makes sure neurons aren’t just “memorizing” the input data. This is especially important because our dataset is relatively small (~2000 observations even after augmentation), so making sure that our machine learning model can generalize outside of this limited dataset is really important.\n\n```python\nlayer = LSTM(64)(layer)\n```\n\nWe have yet another LSTM layer! By having these two chained right after each other, the first layer can pass all the values of all of its hidden states to the second layer, effectively allowing a sort of ‘deeper’ neural network.\n\n![credit: Jianjing Zhang 2018](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*0BRdnA5sJBYbaeR9)*credit: Jianjing Zhang 2018*\n\nThis deep LSTM allows our network to learn more abstract concepts, making them well suited for natural language tasks.\n\n```python\nlayer = Dense(256, name='FC1')(layer)\n```\n\nNext, we have something called a Fully Connected layer, or a Dense layer. In a dense layer, each of the input neurons is connected to every output neuron. This kind of ‘glue’ layer helps the network to pick out and discriminate feature output by our previous LSTM layer.\n\n```python\nlayer = Dense(1, name='out_layer')(layer)\nlayer = Activation('sigmoid')(layer)\n```\n\nSimilarly, we have one final Dense layer that ‘compresses’ all of the hidden units down to one neuron. However, we want the output value of this neuron to be how confident from a scale of 0 to 1 it is that the intent is valid. We do this by applying something called an activation function.\n\n![A sigmoid activation function](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*kdowh3GOGOUvGBr0)\n\nIn this case, the particular function we chose is the sigmoid activation function, which looks something like the above.\n\n### Model Overview\n\nPhew, finally got through everything! After putting it all together, we end up with a network that looks something like this:\n\n```python\n# 75 max_seq_len\n# 1000 tokenizer_vocab_size\nmodel = net.RNN(75, 1000) \nmodel.summary()\n\n# _________________________________________________________________\n# Layer (type)                 Output Shape              Param #   \n# =================================================================\n# inputs (InputLayer)          (None, 75)                0         \n# _________________________________________________________________\n# embedding_1 (Embedding)      (None, 75, 64)            64000     \n# _________________________________________________________________\n# lstm_1 (LSTM)                (None, 75, 64)            33024     \n# _________________________________________________________________\n# dropout_1 (Dropout)          (None, 75, 64)            0         \n# _________________________________________________________________\n# lstm_2 (LSTM)                (None, 64)                33024     \n# _________________________________________________________________\n# FC1 (Dense)                  (None, 256)               16640     \n# _________________________________________________________________\n# dropout_2 (Dropout)          (None, 256)               0         \n# _________________________________________________________________\n# out_layer (Dense)            (None, 1)                 257       \n# _________________________________________________________________\n# activation_1 (Activation)    (None, 1)                 0         \n# =================================================================\n# Total params: 146,945\n# Trainable params: 146,945\n# Non-trainable params: 0\n# _________________________________________________________________\n```\n\nTheres a grand total of 150,000 different trainable knobs and parameters in our neural network!\n\n## Training pipeline\n\nSo, how does the data we got earlier play a role in helping our machine learning model learn and improve?\n\nThe first component is the **loss function.** This component tells the neural network how ‘correct’ its prediction was. In this model, we will use something called [binary cross entropy](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-binary-cross-entropy-log-loss-a-visual-explanation-a3ac6025181a), which is basically a fancy word for log-based error. If the true label is 1, we can then show what the log-loss would be for some given prediction probability.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*8rd4ho_3Y6zrtra-.png)\n\nNext, we need to pick an **optimizer**. This component tells the neural network how to change its parameters to improve or ‘optimize’ itself. In this model, we chose to use an optimizer called [RMSProp](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-rmsprop-faster-neural-network-learning-62e116fcf29a) with a learning rate of 1e-3 . We aren’t going to cover all the technical details of this optimizer in this blog post, but just know that it is a very fast and effective optimizer.\n\n![RMSProp(black) vs a bunch of other optimizers. credit: Vitaly Bushaev](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*HZM5XJ-quu276w39.gif)*RMSProp(black) vs a bunch of other optimizers. credit: Vitaly Bushaev*\n\nOne important hyperparameter we choose is the **train-test split.** In data science and machine learning, we typically withhold part of our data and set it aside as a **test set**. The rest of the data will be considered the **training set.** When training the model, we never feed it the test set. As a result, we can use the test set as a metric to see how well it would perform on real-world, unseen data. In our training, we used a train-test split of 20%.\n\nAnother important hyperparameter that we can choose is the **mini-batch size**. The mini-batch size determines how many training examples we feed the machine learning model before updating its parameters. A smaller mini-batch means that we get more frequent updates to the parameters, but it also runs the risk of having outliers that may cause a bad gradient update. A large mini-batch means that we get a more accurate gradient update but it also takes longer. A similar concept is *sample size* in statistics. We could pick a larger sample to get a better estimate of the overall population, but it is often more expensive to do so. A smaller sample might contain outliers and thus be less robust of an estimate of the overall population, but it very easy to do. So, there’s this tradeoff between accuracy and speed. We found that a good balance between these was a mini-batch size of 128.\n\nWe then trained our neural network over 10 epochs. A single epoch is one iteration over the entire dataset. If we train it for too many epochs, you run the risk of overfitting (memorizing the training data), but we don’t train it enough, we run the risk of not discovering a better model. One thing we can do it minimize this problem is through the use of cross-validation, which is a technique that lets us ‘test’ on portions of the training set. Essentially, at each iteration during training, we withhold a portion of the training set and use it as a sort of ‘validation’.\n\n![credit: Raheel Shaikh](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*6XoMgZUd3SxXgqBj.png)*credit: Raheel Shaikh*\n\nBy seeing when this validation accuracy goes down, we can get a pretty good idea of when our model begins to overfit on our data, and stop the training before this happens. In training our model, we will use 5-fold [cross-validation](https://towardsdatascience.com/cross-validation-explained-evaluating-estimator-performance-e51e5430ff85).\n\nAfter all of this, we end with a training accuracy of 93.60% and test accuracy of 85.95%. Not bad at all!\n\n## Serving the model\n\nGreat! So now we have a trained model. Can we put that in the Chrome extension now? Not quite yet…\n\nOur model was written and trained with Keras (a Python Deep Learning library). Our Chrome extension is written in TypeScript. How do we get these two to work together?\n\nLuckily for us, Tensorflow.js exists! This library allows us to run Tensorflow models from within JavaScript. Tensorflow has released a script that lets us to convert a Keras model into something that Tensorflow.js understands, so we can run that to convert our models.\n\nHowever, we can’t just directly plug-and-play. You may remember that we did all of that data preprocessing before we trained our model. Tensorflow.js doesn’t have any of this built in, so we made our own implementation of it. You can check it out [here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/reflect-chrome/blob/master/src/nn.ts).\n\nWe’ll leave all the technical code out (if you’re interested, feel free to peek around the source code!), but we’ve abstracted it enough that classifying an intent is a breeze.\n\n```typescript\n// declared somewhere earlier\nconst model: nn.IntentClassifier = new nn.IntentClassifier(\"acc85.95\"); // name of converted model\n\n// send to nlp model for prediction\nconst valid: boolean = await model.predict(intent);\nif (valid) {\n    // let through\n} else {\n    // block page\n}\n```\n\n## Future improvement\n\n### Possible models\n\nWe have thought about using something more established and complex like [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) and retraining it on our dataset, however then comes the problem of runtime and memory usage.\n\nBERT is a huge model. If you thought 150 thousand parameters was a lot, wait till you see BERT’s 110 *million* parameters. This bad boy takes a few hundred times longer and many times more memory than our current model. While yes BERT may perform really well, we just don’t think it has a place inside of a Chrome extension.\n\nOur model is decently robust as it is, especially considering the entire model is \u003c2MB and takes less than 200ms to run in browser. For now, we will stick with lightweight models, but we may switch if we find a better match in the future :)\n\n### Misclassifications\n\nOf course, this algorithm isn’t perfect. It does have a lot of flaws and weaknesses that we find every day, and we’re working to fix those! If there are any misclassifications that you find in the algorithm, we love to hear about it on our feedback form: [https://forms.gle/ctypb6FmDT9RQqjv6](https://forms.gle/ctypb6FmDT9RQqjv6).\n\n## Closing\n\nThis NLP model is at the core of reflect. It is this model’s goal to predict whether user intents are valid or not. As a result, we need to make sure this algorithm is accurate, fast, and lightweight. Hopefully, through this blog post, you’ve learned a little about how we went about building a model to fulfill those requirements.\n\nLearn more about us on our website! ✨ [http://getreflect.app/](http://getreflect.app/)\n\nIf you have any further questions about reflect or this NLP model, feel free to shoot us an email at hello@getreflect.app","lastmodified":"2022-02-15T20:23:08.88547976Z","title":"reflect: NLP Model Explained"},"/templates/post":{"content":"---\ntitle: \"{{title}}\"\ndate: {{date}}\n---\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-02-15T20:23:08.88547976Z","title":"Untitled Page"},"/thoughts/A-City-is-not-a-Computer":{"content":"Reboot event with Shannon Mattern on her new book _A City Is Not A Computer_.

More generally, they are both names for structures of sets.\n\n\u003e For the human mind, the tree is the easiest vehicle for complex thoughts. But the city is not, cannot and must not be a tree. The city is a receptacle for life. If the receptacle severs the overlap of the strands of life within it, because it is a tree, it will be like a bowl full of razor blades on edge, ready to cut up whatever is entrusted to it. In such a receptacle life will be cut to pieces. If we make cities which are trees, they will cut our life within to pieces.\n\n## [Urban planning](thoughts/urban%20planning.md)\nColumbia, Maryland → Neighbourhoods, in clusters of five, form 'villages'. Transportation joins the villages into a new town.

The symbol is apt, for, of course, the organization of the army was designed precisely in order to create discipline and rigidity.\n\n## Abolish hierarchies\nWhenever we have a tree structure, it means that within this structure no piece of any unit is ever connected to other units, except through the its parent (meaning the unit as a whole)\n\nDoes power always need to function top down?\n\n\u003e \"The enormity of this restriction is difficult to grasp.

How will you keep them in your mind, in your mind's eye? However you do it, you will do it by grouping them. Maybe two fruits and two sports balls together. In doing so, you construct a tree structure. Maybe you group it by size, two small spheres and two large spheres. This constructs another tree. But try as hard as you like, two trees combined form a semilattice. It is very difficult to hold a semilattice in your head.\n\nMaybe this is where tools like knowledge graphs come in.

Wildfire ensures that miners are selfishly incentivised to store and share data as quickly as possible with other miners in the network, in order to build a positive reputation. While more complex under the hood, Wildfire can be summarised as: ‘if you share with me, I will share with you’. As nodes in blockweave networks require fast access to data in order to mine efficiently, they are selfishly-incentivised to give data to other members of the network promptly and continuously, autonomously improving the sharing to lightning-fast speeds.\n\nThe blockweave solves two fundamental problems currently associated with public decentralised blockchains:\n- On-chain storage constraints; and\n- Unsustainable consensus mechanisms\n\nIn order for an information store to be truly permanent, it must be both [fault tolerant](thoughts/fault%20tolerance.md) and [decentralized](thoughts/decentralization.md). Blockchain technology has much obvious promise in the area of resilient, decentralized information preservation, as a key feature of the technology is that all data inside the blockchain is immutable, and cannot be altered once it is stored. However, traditionally, such technology severely lacks scalability which clearly limits its utility for storing significant quantities of data.\n\nOf especially great importance is users ability to reliably maintain\naccess to all permaweb applications and websites themselves, not simply the\ncontent they display, forever.\n\nRequiring PoA incentivises storage as miners need access to random blocks from the blockweave’s history in order to mine new blocks and receive mining rewards.\n\nUnlike traditional blockchain systems, Arweave does not have a typical notion of full and light clients – merely clients that downloaded more or less of the blockweave. With Arweave, full synchronisation is not a risk or an obligation, but an optional upgrade path for which miners receive higher rewards.\n\nFrom the user’s perspective,  there are two types of transactions in the network:  data transactions and value transactions.  A user can initiate a data transaction to store data in a block.\n\nRather, most of the transaction fee is contributed towards a storage endowment, which is distributed to the wallets of miners over time.\n\nFrom our current position, at an optimistic 30% annual data density growth rate, it will take 434 years to reach the maximum theoretical limit, at 20% – 697 years, at 10% AGR – 1,329 years.\n\nArchive nesting\n- This does not mean that we expect that the information stored inside the weave will be lost after the final block is mined\n- It is our expectation that when eventually a permanent information storage system more suited to the challenges of the time emerges, the Arweave’s data will be ‘subsumed’ into this network.\n- This pattern of ‘nesting’ of archives when they are retired is common across human history. An archive of Gopherspace (a ‘knowledge web’, prior to the HTTP-based web) can be found inside the Arweave’s permaweb. In-side the Gopherspace archive, one can find archives of earlier Telnet and bulletin board-based discussion systems\n\nContent policies\n- Given that the miners collectively maintain the Arweave network, a mechanism is required to allow them to express their opinions on what content should and should not be hosted in the system.\n- Nodes express preferences about content through content policies. Content policies  can  be  arbitrary  computation  performed  upon  transactions  that classify them as acceptable or not acceptable to the local node.  In the reference Arweave implementation, content policies are supported in the form of substring matches as well as hashes of the data stored in the transaction.\n- Two complementary incentives at play here\n\t- An incentive not to over-zealously reject too many transactions, as this would lead to a decline in mining rewards\n\t- An incentive not to accept transactions that the majority of the network is likely to reject, as this will result in mining candidate blocks that the rest of the network will ignore\n\n## Architectures\n### Client-server\nTraditional web or native applications have a client-server architecture. This model is still possible with the Arweave, as a web server can act as a front-end for data stored on the network’s permanent ledger.\n\nIn this centralised Arweave-app model, these services can maintain a pool of AR tokens in order to pay for data storage requests on behalf of the client.\n\n### Serverless\nDecentralised applications reside directly on and operate directly from the blockweave itself, and can be accessed by a typical web browser. \n\nServerless applications hosted on the Arweave network allow users to pay directly  for  their  interactions  with  the  network.   This  frees  the  developer from having to subsidise the cost of user interactions themselves\n\n## DNS\nThe owner of a domain can run a permanently-available, decentralized web application just by storing a transaction on the Arweave network and registering DNS records via the usual external service providers\n\nYou need\n1. A DNS CNAME record pointing to an Arweave gateway: `www CNAME arweave-gateway.net`\n2.

New buildings need to be designed with the expectation that they will evolve, because they usually outlive their initial use. Even if a building does not change its use (e.g. it remains the same university department), the needs of its users will change and the building will need to adapt. This should be done, for example, by making sure that changing the space layout in the building is possible without changing the structure.\n\n## XAI systems\nIn the last case (organized complexity and non-repetitive digital systems), the complexity of the problem cannot be reduced - we need to consider a large number of interacting processes or components. At the same time, all of them are equally important and play an important role in some aspect of the system. As Jane Jacobs puts it, the large number of interrelated variables form an organic whole.

Note that some of his logic is implicit in his idea of perfection. Note that to evaluate an argument, you need to first explain the argument, and then say why it is or is not successful.*\n\nDescartes, in his meditations, wishes to find a foundation of knowledge that will still stand strong even after doubting the most basic facts about the world. In doing so, he starts by methodically doubting all things that he has \"less than complete certainty\" of. He casts asides sensory experience, claiming that these can be deceived. Even objects close by could be illusory as he could be dreaming. Even basic axioms of the world like mathematics could be false because of some evil genius that has \"employed all his energies in order to deceive me\". Iteratively, he tries to re-prove existence of many things, starting from the existence of self (*\"cogito, ergo sum\"*) and progressing towards an argument for the existence of God (and god as a perfect being who cannot be a deceiver.)\n\nIn the Fifth Meditation, Descartes presents the argument as follows:\n1.  Suppose there is a supremely perfect being -- a being that has every possible 'perfect' trait. A supremely perfect being *must* have every possible perfect trait because to exclude any or all perfections from a supremely perfect being is to stumble into a contradiction or to \"conceive of a mountain without a valley\".\n2. Necessary existence is a perfection. It is an existence where one depends only on the self for existence (similar to the concept of independent origination in [emptiness](thoughts/emptiness.md)).\n3. Necessary existence cannot be separated from the essence of a supremely perfect being.\n4. Therefore, a supremely perfect being exists -- it is God.\n\nHowever, this argument is flawed as it begs the question -- the premise (that there exists a supremely perfect being) is also the conclusion (a supremely perfect being exists). This inherent circular argument then does not hold.\n\nFor the sake of continued examination of the argument, let us assume that this argument is sound, and that God indeed does exist.\n\nDescartes goes on to utilize the statement that God exists to prove that God cannot be a deceiver.\n\n1. God exists and is perfect\n2. Deception is imperfect, therefore God cannot deceive\n3. Whatever I perceive \"clearly and distinctly\" must be true\n4. As my perception is clear, the material world must exist\n\nHowever, this argument also begs the question as it relies on the first proof that God necessarily exists as a premise. Unfortunately, Descartes first proof relies on the fact that Descartes has a clear and distinct idea of God, which presupposes clear and distinct perception (the conclusion of this argument). Thus, to show that his perception is clear, he must assume that his perception is clear -- clearly an invalid argument.","lastmodified":"2022-02-15T20:23:08.88547976Z","title":"Descartes' Meditations"},"/thoughts/Design-Justice":{"content":"## Summary\nDesign Justice focuses not just on design in the visual and aesthetic sense, but also on the design of systems.\n\nTo quote from the book, \"Design justice rethinks design processes, centers people who are normally marginalized by design, and uses collaborative, creative practices to address the deepest challenges our communities face.\" The norms, values, and assumptions that are encoded and reproduced in the *design* of systems can be changed by rethinking our design processes.\n\nIn less than 400 short pages, Sasha Costanza-Chock covers a breadth of topics ranging from intersectionality, bias, and universal design to maintenance, design sites, and technosolutionism -- all through detailed case studies of real-world design practices and social movements.\n\nShe guides the reader into how the 'unmarked user' and universal design erases certain groups of people within the matrix of domination (through ableist, eurocentric, and classist assumptions) and refutes the argument that 'design by committee produces mediocrity.'\n\nDesign Justice is a book that invites us to \"center people who are too often marginalized by design\". More importantly, it urges us to work towards an equitable world for everyone: one which treats design justice not as a funnel that we use to limit ourselves to a minimal set of supposedly universal design choices, but rather as a prism through which to generate a far wider rainbow of possible choices, each better tailored to reflect the needs of a specific group of people.\n\n## Reflection\nDesign sites are valorized as places of learning, making, and building and the intersection of social movements and the counterculture. Why then, have they become increasingly corporate places of extraction of free labour?\n\nThis cooptation of [hacker](thoughts/Hackers.md) culture, hackathons as design sites in particular, by neoliberalism has been on the back of my mind ever since reading the chapter on design sites in Design Justice. As someone who first got their footing in computer science through hackathons, it pains me to see that this is the rep that hackathons have slowly gotten over time, moving from safe spaces for idea exploration to increasingly corporate, time-bound, events where hackers spin up apps to test company products in exchange for the slim chance of winning prizes and recognition.\n\nHackathons reshape precarious and unpaid work. Writing code and building apps for free becomes an extraordinary opportunity and a collective imagination for fictional expectations of innovation that benefits all. Do we so necessarily need to tie these rituals of play in building and tinkering to the recruiting and product testing pipeline for large corporations?\n\nAs a hackathon organizer, Design Justice has helped me to more actively think about what hackathons are trying to motivate. Having more of the tools to articulate and locate exactly why hackathons have felt increasingly corporate is the first step to reinstate hackathons as third spaces not as places of creation or competition, but as places of play and exploration.\n\n## Quotes\n### Defining Design Justice\nHow larger systems -- including norms, values, and assumptions -- are encoded in and reproduced through the design of sociotechnical systems.

An object's affordances are never equally perceptible to all, and never equally available to all.\n\n### On Intersectionality\nBlock women workers at GM were told they had no legal grounds for a discrimination case against their employer because antidiscrimination law only protected single-identity categories.\n\nThe concept of intersectionality provided the grounds for a long, slow paradigm shift that is still unfolding in the social sciences, in legal scholarship, and in other domains of research and practice.\n\nWhile there is rapidly growing interest in algorithmic bias audits, especially in the fairness, accoutnability, and transparency in machine learning (FAT*) community, most are single-axis: they look for a biased distribution of error rates only according to a single variable, such as race or gender.\n\nOne question about [intersectional approaches] is how many identity variables to include because each adds complexity (and, in many situations, time and cost) to audits.\n\n### [Bias](thoughts/bias.md)\n\n3 groups of study\n1.

Emergent Bias: may not have been biased given its original [context](thoughts/context.md) of use or original user base but comes to exhibit bias when the context shifts or when new users arrive\n\n### Universal Design\nUniversal Design (UD) as defined by Center for UD at North Carolina State University: The design of products and environment to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design\n\nAt least in the digital domain, adaptive design that enables personalization and flexible configuration of shared core objects, tools, platforms, and systems provides a path out of the tension between the diverse needs of individual users and the economic advantages of a large-scale user base.\n\nUniversalization erases difference and produces self-reinforcing spirals of exclusion, but personalized and culturally adawptive systems too often are deployed in ways that reinforce surveillance capitalism.\n\nWe should destabilize the underlying assumption that what is best for the majority of users is best for *all* users.\n\n### The Unmarked User\nDesigners most frequently assume that the unmarked user has access to several very powerful privileges, such as US citizenship, English language proficiency, access to broadband internet, a smartphone, a normatively abled body, and so on.\n\nFor broader reasons of structural inequality, the universe of real-world users falls within a limited range compared to the full breadth of *potential* users, then [user-centered design](thoughts/human%20centered%20design.md) reproduces exclusion by centering their needs.\n\n### Disability Simulation\nThese 'simulations' produce an unrealistic understanding of the life experience of disability for a number of reasons: the nondisabled person does not have the alternate skill sets developed by [disabled people], and thus overestimates the loss of function which disability presents, and is furthermore likely to think of able-normative solutions rather than solutions more attuned to a [disabled person's] life experience\n\nDisability simulation is discredited; lived experience is nontransferable. \"Don't start by building a new table; start by coming to the table\"\n\n### Dismantling Existing Systems\ni.e. what's wrong with colour blindness\n\n\"Under this new rhetoric of colour-blindness, equality means treating all individuals the same, regardless of differences they brought with them due to the effects of past discrimination or even discrimination in other venues\"\n\nNew Jim Code\nAlgorithmic decision systems based on historical data sets reinforce white seupremacy and discrimination even as they are positioned by their designers as \"fair\"\n\nRacial hierarchies can only be dismantled by actively antiracist systems design, not by pretending they don't exist.\n\nFar too often, user personas are created out of thin air by members of the design team, based on their own assumption or stereotypes about groups of people. When this happens, user personas are literally objectified assumptions about end users.\n\n### [Maintenance](thoughts/maintenance.md)\n\n[Creating new vs maintaing old](thoughts/creation%20vs%20maintenance.md)\n- Contributing to an existing project requires contacting and negotiating with the existing developers, maintainers, and community. Creating someething new produces attribution, credit, and visibility for its developers, whereas attribution, credit, and visibility for participating in an existing project must, at the very least, be shared.\n- Support maintenance, not just \"innovation.\" Significant resources are necessary to maintain and improve existing movement tech, but most focus is on the creation of new projects.\n\n\"Those of us working to promote universal access to clean water and sanitation must keep our eyes not just on the competition and prizes, but on the less glamorous work of encouraging adoption, usage, and maintenace\"\n\n### Technosolutionism/Technochauvinism\nNew technology will save us!!\n\nAn exclusionary and elitist understanding of what technology is and where it comes from and a lack of interest in preexisting, community-based desigbn practices.\n\n\"... where we are wholly dependent on a handful of extraordinarily gifted entrepreneurs to lead us out of the dark ages. This is a myth.\"\n\nFirst, it contains a somewhat masked normative assumption that \"technology adoption\" is always a good thing.\n\nNeoliberal, technocentric ideas about the city as a machine or as a software system waiting to be optimized have become increasingly prominent. Citizens should not be reduced to users through the lens of neoliberal governmentality.\n\nFirst consider what already works at the community level, and to steer students away from the pitfalls of tech solutionism and technochauvanism\n\n### [Attention economy](thoughts/attention%20economy.md)\n\nMediated visibility has become an important form of capital. Attention (time) is a scarce resource within late-stage informational capitalism, and its allocation has significant symbolic and material impacts.\n\n\"Design challenges\" in which dozens, sometimes hundreds, of people do free labour and submit ideas in hopes that they'll be the lucky one chosen to receive visibility, recognition, and possibly even compensation.\n\n### Design Sites\nTracing the cooptation of hacker culture by neoliberalism\n\nInvisibility of subaltern communites may also be strategic. Sometimes, they shield their practices and innovations from mainstream visibility to avoid incorporation and appropriation.\n\n\"Alternative spaces and forms of living provided interesting ideas could be milked and marketed. So certain structural features of these 'indie' movement outputs were suddenly highly acclaimed, applied, and copy-pasted into capitalist developing laboratories\" ([Post-It Note City](thoughts/Post-It%20Note%20City.md))\n\nHackspaces in the European context, which they describe as originally being \"third spaces\" outside of the logic of both the communist state and the capitalist market. \n\nThe assumption that making sites \"open\" makes them inclusive, without specifically addressing race, class, gender, and/or disability dynamics, is common to many privileged design sites.\n\nMany who are active in these design sites feel themselves to be participants in *commons-based peer production,* or \"decentralized, collaborative, and non-proprietary; base on sharing resources and outputs among widely distributed, loosely connected individuals who cooperate with each other without relying on either market signals or managerial commands\"\n\nWithout intentional intervention, these spaces find it very difficult to fulfill even their own liberal democratic rhetoric because they end up dominated by white cis men and by middle-class people with free time and disposable income.\n\nMore on hackathons: [hackathons](posts/hackathons.md)\n\n#### Hackathons: The Bad\n\nHackathons are understood by corporate managers as potentially effective ways to identify new talent, and therefore as a possible mechanism in the tech sector hiring pipeline. \n\n\"Hackathons, time-bounded events where participants write computer code and build apps, have become a popular means of socializing tech students and workers to produce 'innovation' despite little promise of material reward... [they] reshape unpaid and precarious work as an extraordinary opportunity, a ritual of ecstatic labour, and a collective imaginary for fictional expectations of innovation that benefits all, a powerful strategy for manufacturing works' consent in the 'new' economy.\" (Sharon Zukin and Max Papadantonakis)\n\nHackathons provide excellent opportunities for the extraction of free labour.\n\nThe assumption that a \"hackathon for good\" will be successful if it produces a new app that can help \"solve\" a social problem runs deep.\n\nHackathons nearly always focus on problems and rarely build on existing community assets; and people thing hackathons can do things that they usually can't, such as solve big or even little problems, create new products overnight, or 'level the playing field' of innovation through meritocracy. \"A one day hack for homelessness takes away from the complexity of social justice issues. ... You can't just come up with an app and solve the world's problems\"\n\n\"Hackathon spaces cultivate a culture that marginalizes hackers with specific needs, including but not limited to women, people with disabilities, people with non-traditional backgrounds, and even individuals with specific dietary restrictions. By consistently ignoring the health, diet, and care needs of diverse attendees, along with needs based on skill, class, and gender identities, hackathons create an exclusive and hostile environment.\"\n\n#### Hackathons: The Good\nThey are often crucibles of intense and focused learning, making, problem-solving, communtiy building, and play.\n\n\"In the old days people used to form teams and rush in and try to fix things, without really even knowing what was broken ... it is no longer just a bunch of programmers in a room. There are now hackathons where actual community members are learning to code and interacting. ... Community members are also teaching programmers about the things they need to sustain and build for the future. That's a really good thing happening\"\n\nSuch hackathons push hackers to reflect on why they are doing the work they do, push for the ideas and welfare of marginalized communities in the tech sphere, and do so on the terms of their wellbeing and safety.\n\nOrganizers should pay attention to participants as whole human beings. For example, this means that it is important to consider food, bio breaks, accessible bathrooms that are friendly to all body types and genders, comfortable spaces to nap or relax, and decent lighting, etc.\n\n### Design Justice Pedagogies\n\"Critical pedagogy, where the role of the educator is to pose problems, create spaces for the collective development of critical consciousness, help to develop plans for action to make the world a better place, and develop a sense of agency among learners\"\n\n\"No one knows everything, but together we know a lot, if we listen to each other\"\n\nKey elements\n* Teach data science in a way that honours context, respects situated knowledge, and makes it clear that data is never \"raw\".\n* Emphasize the user of data to create shared meaning over individual mastery.\n* Teach data science that values not only reason, but ethics and emotions as well\n\n### Critiques\n\"Design by commitee produces mediocrity\" or \"we don't want to end up with the lowest-common-denominator design!\"\n\nIt's true that design justice practitioners have to take care that critique does not become our primary activity; an overemphasis on testing, evaluation, and critique can indeed be ultimately disempowering. At the same time, explicit critique paired with alternative proposals can be very productive.\n\nDesign justice doesn't imply that we must somehow reduce our options to only those that satisfy all accessibility criteria for the most marginalized within the matrix of domination. It is not meant to be a *filter* that we use to eliminate most design possibilities from consideration because they fail an accessibility checklist. In fact, design justice as a framework is meant to do the opposite: to act not as a funnel that we use to limit ourselves to a minimal set of supposedly universal design choics, but rather as a prism through which to generate a far wider rainbow of possible choices, each better tailored to reflect the needs of a specific group of people.","lastmodified":"2022-02-15T20:23:08.88547976Z","title":"Design Justice"},"/thoughts/Do-Artifacts-Have-Politics":{"content":"\"In controversies about technology and society, there is no idea more provocative than the notion that technical things have political qualities\"\n\n\"A long lineage of boosters have insisted that the 'biggest and best' that science and industry made available were the best guarantees of democracy, freedom, and social justice\" -- seeing these arguments esp wrt [web3](thoughts/web3.md) being a strong driver for these same values\n\n\"What matters is not technology itself, but the social or economic system in which it is embedded.\"\n\n\"Seemingly innocuous design features in mass transit systems, water projects, industrial machinery, and other technologies actually mask social choices of profound significance.\" (societal impact is treated as an externality, those which do not matter when 'just considering efficiency')\n\n\"The things we call 'technologies' are just ways of building order in our world.\"\n\n\"In that sense technological innovations are similar to legislative acts or political foundings that establish a framework for public order that will endure over many generations.\"\n\n### How artifacts can contain political properties\n\"Politics\" is defined as \"arrangements of power and authority in human associations as well as the activities that take place within those arrangements.\"\n\n1. \"Instances in which the invention, design, or arrangement of a specific technical device or system becomes a way of settling an issue in a particular community.\"\n2. \"Cases of what can be called inherently political technologies, man-made systems that appear to require, or to be strongly compatible with, particular kinds of political relationships\"\n\n\"Technological change expresses a panoply of human motives, not the least of which is the desire of some to have dominion over others, even though it may require an occasional sacrifice of cost-cutting and some violence to the norm of getting more from less\"\n\n## The mechanical tomato harvester\nA remarkable device perfected by researchers at UC from the late 1940s to present.

How much you see importance of media / social networking vs technical revolution?\n-   WEC was not a marketplace, rather an aggregator of information (a pre-Google search engine)\n-   What tools do you want to bring to a commune (ex: farming commune)\n    -   Food, housing, basics\n-   Why would you need a calculator and a book on cybernetics on a farm?\n    -   Tools which allow you to fundamentally understand the world in a different way\n    -   Appropriation!\n-   Catalogue provides the infrastructure → leads to conferences which lead to development of more infrastructure\n-   Network Entrepreneur sees several decentralized groups that aren't connected and services as a connector\n\n### Connection between WEC and WELL\n-   picture yourself as a hippie in the 1980's, communes will save the world and end warmaking America\n    -   California is tech driven, everything is failing\n    -   Black panthers have been crushed\n-   Howard Rheingold (the virtual community → on wiki someone find it)\n-   Electronic Frontier → empty society/land of consciousness\n-   Larry Bird, most influential people in silicon valley\n\n### Our current state seems somewhat inevitable, were there any inflection points along the way that could have changed the direction\n-   Counterculture legitimates a project that is already underway\n-   Different in ways that we don't talk about as much\n    -   Gone right\n        -   The power of email, allows you to have institutional and parainstitutional ties\n        -   The power of search, reams of first hand information instantly\n    -   Gone wrong\n        -   Economics of [incentives](thoughts/incentives.md) and bad actors\n        -   Individuating users and centralize control of information, enables advertising en masse\n            -   Although it predates technology via TV and radio, amplified by\n    -   Government have to intervene, like oil companies mining our social world\n        -   Must let go of communalist dream of collective consciousness\n\n### Era of connected machines → connected humans\n-   Enabled by technological development\n-   Can this be beneficial for everyone rather than just the privileged?\n-   Tech that has been sold to us as devices of personal empowered\n    -   not only corporate sponsored but also partnered with the state\n    -   intersection of Big Tech and the state is an uh oh → military industrial complex never really goes away\n\n### Where is todays counterculture\n-   Not the left, but actually the right\n-   Concern is not big data and ML but with corporations and states\n-   Place of rebellion is not at the data level but at the institution and union level (in big corporations) + legal level (ex: protection of Uber drivers)\n-   There are bodies and factories and server farms → lets not forget the basis of our abstractions\n\n### What can we learn from the promises/pitfalls of Steward Brand\n-   Performative politics\n    -   false belief that finding ourselves in our mid 20s is gonna change the world\n    -   rather, by engaging and learning from people who are vastly different from us, BE political\n    -   don't isolate, break out and do politics\n-   don't build communities of consciousness\n    -   build places of exchange, places where public decision making and CHANGE happens","lastmodified":"2022-02-15T20:23:08.88547976Z","title":"From Counterculture to Cyberculture"},"/thoughts/Galls-law":{"content":"## Gall's Law\nA rule of thumb for [complexity](thoughts/complexity.md) system design: simple alphabets produce complex behaviors, complex alphabets produce stupid behaviors\n\n\u003e A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked.

All information should be free.\n\nSqueezing in time where no one else would (sniping people even 1 min late at 3am in the morning). This culture seemed to almost arise bottom-up from the scarcity of compute resources at the early 60s and 70s, especially around the MIT area where there seemed to be a lot more spare compute time and just really smart, curious people.\n\n\u003e What was a computer but something that benefited from a free flow of information?\n### Decentralization\nThe best way to promote free exchange of information is to have an open system, one with no boundaries attached. The worst thing to encourage this is to have a bureaucracy.\n\nThe difference between bureaucrats and and logical algorithms are that bureaucrats follow *arbitrary rules* whereas algorithms follow *concrete and transparent* rules.\n\n## Paul Graham\n[Source: Hackers and Painters by *Paul Graham*](http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html)\n\nThe art of hacking: for building and exploring for the sake of building and exploring.\n\n### Hacking as a creative art\n\u003e They seemed to think that hacking and painting were very different kinds of work-- that hacking was cold, precise, and methodical, and that painting was the frenzied expression of some primal urge.\nPG is positing that hacking (traditionally seen as more as more mechanical) and painting (seen as more creative) have a lot in common -- most importantly, the face that they make things.\n\nFor hackers, computers are just the medium through which they express themselves.\n\nNamely, they don't exclusively try for exclusively [creating or maintaining](thoughts/creation%20vs%20maintenance.md) but rather to make 'good things' and if either of those happen along the way, all the better.\n\n### [Labels](thoughts/quantization.md)\n\u003e But often this mismatch [between labels and what they do] causes problems. It's easy to drift away from building beautiful things toward building ugly things that make more suitable subjects for research papers.\nLabels are logically [decentralized](thoughts/decentralization.md) so if it no longer is useful, then it will phase itself out. While yes, language is useful for defining norms externally, for those *strongly* intrinsically motivated (which arguably are the people PG is trying to speak to), those labels don't matter because external incentives matter very little to them. If that label continues to be useful to them (e.g. to secure funding or to talk about it to laypeople) then why not continue to use it? \n\nI think my case for this argument would be slightly different if PG focused more on the *public* perception of the label.\n\n### [Academia](thoughts/academia.md)\n1. Research must be original -- this drives people to stake out a piece of ground no one wants\n2. Research must be substantial -- awkard problems mean more substance to write about and solve, discouraging elegant solutions\n\nMaybe because better incentive systems are so much harder to create and evaluate. Numbers are easy and an easy test that kind-of works is really tempting to stick with.\n\n### Industry\n\"Universities and research labs force hackers to be scientists, and companies force them to be engineers... Programmers were seen as technicians who translated the visions (if that is the word) of product managers into code.\" (re: [academia](thoughts/academia.md))\n\nThis feels like a problem of scale: only a small percentage of hackers *can* actually design software and it's hard for people running a company to pick these out\n\nBig companies want to damp oscillation/standard deviation of results, they have shareholders to which they are accountable. They win by sucking less than their competitors, not making great products.\n\n\"But when you damp oscillations, you lose the high points as well as the low.\" ([Vanilla Ice Cream effect](thoughts/Vanilla%20Ice%20Cream%20effect.md))\n\n### Figuring things out as you go\n\n\u003e If I had only looked over at the other makers, the painters or the architects, I would have realized that there was a name for what I was doing: sketching.\nThe traditional approach is to logically plan things out and to create with intention. PG argues that sketching -- figuring out the program as one writes it -- is just as valid.\n\nA programming language is for thinking of programs, not for expressing programs you've already thought of. The argument *against* strong typing is really interesting. I like to think of strong typing as ruler lines or a guide to ensure that the perspective of my drawing is right; a good aid to ensure that I'm on the right track. \n\nHackers also learn by doing. Hackers, from the start, are doing original work; it's just very bad. They start original, and get good. On the contrary, academics and scientists start good and get original.\n\n### Demand\n\u003e Prices are determined by supply and demand, and there is just not as much demand for things that are fun to work on as there is for things that solve the mundane problems of individual customers.\nSimilar to [creation vs maintenance](thoughts/creation%20vs%20maintenance.md), there seems to be a need to artificially incentivize the difficult work (e.g. [maintenance](thoughts/maintenance.md) or mundane problems)","lastmodified":"2022-02-15T20:23:08.88547976Z","title":"Hackers"},"/thoughts/Hard-problem-of-consciousness":{"content":"Related: [mind body problem](thoughts/mind%20body%20problem.md), [Materialism](thoughts/Materialism.md)\n\nHow do we bridge objective description and subjective experience (qualia)?

Physicalism (read: [Materialism](thoughts/Materialism.md)) is the thesis that everything that exists is physical. \n2. Physical facts then, are objective truth (\"the kind that can be observed and understood from many points of view and by individuals with different perceptual systems\")\n3. Even if we knew everything about how the bat's sonar system works, we would not know what is is like for the bat to perceive using this system.\n\t1. 'What it's like': in this case, something is conscious (a bat) if and only if there is something it's like to be that being (only a bat knows what it is like for a bat to be a bat)\n\t2. One, for example, cannot imagine a chair to know what it is like for a chair to be a chair.\n\t3. For a state to be conscious is for it to have a subjective character (to seem or feel a certain way to the subject). A conscious experience is a state that is both subjective and qualitative.\n4. Therefore, complete knowledge of the physical facts about a bat's  perceptual system would not yield knowledge of certain facts about a  bat’s experiences\n\nPhysicalism leaves out the subjective facts, so it’s a mystery how it \ncould be true (give that [qualia](thoughts/qualia.md) and the subjective experience exists).\n\nRelated: Frank Jackson's [Knowledge Argument](thoughts/Knowledge%20Argument.md)","lastmodified":"2022-02-15T20:23:08.88547976Z","title":"Hard problem of consciousness"},"/thoughts/How-to-do-Nothing":{"content":"On the [attention economy](thoughts/attention%20economy.md).

Through this, she learns everything there is to know about the physical nature of the world, including all there is to know about the causal and relational facts consequent upon all this, including of course functional roles.\n- If physicalism is true, she knows all there is to know.\n- Yet, if Mary is let out of her black-and-white room or given a colour TV, she will learn what it is like to see something red.\n\nThe implication here is that Mary cannot learn what it is like to subjectively experience red from reading physical facts (similar argument re: [semantics](thoughts/semantics.md) in [Chinese room argument](thoughts/Chinese%20room%20argument.md)).\n\n### Dennett's Refutation of the Knowledge Argument\n\n\u003e “And so, one day, Mary’s captors decided it was time for her to see colours.

How did she do it? ‘Simple,’ she replied. ‘You have to remember that I know everything—absolutely everything— that could ever be known about the physical causes and effects of colour vision.\n\n- No double transduction\n\t- Transduction is a conversion of one for another\n\t- Peripheral/internal transducers are sense organs (e.g. eyes) that transform physically detectable properties to electrochemical signals\n\t- There is no further conversion of neural signals into a qualitative medium\n- No Cartesian theatre in the brain\n\t- There is no central place where all things 'come together' and [consciousness](thoughts/consciousness.md) happens\n\t- Point of view of the observer is smeared over a large volumen of the brain with different networks (distributed model of representation)\n- Consciousness is like fame\n\t- “Just as becoming famous is not a precisely datable event like being transduced into a medium (like being televised), so achieving consciousness in the brain is not a precisely datable transition in the brain.\n- No qualia if intrinsic properties are *instantiated by* rather than *represented by* neural activity\n\n## Essay\n\u003e Critically evaluate Frank Jackson’s “Knowledge Argument.” Does Mary learn something new, and if so, what exactly does she learn and what are the implications for physicalism? If she does not learn anything new, explain how and why this is the case.\n\nIn this paper, I posit that Frank Jackson's \"Knowledge Argument\" is *logically sound* but hinges on many bold and often presumptuous premises to be true. As such, the conclusion should not be taken for granted without more clarifications around premises and terminology.\n\nI propose that Mary has all of the 'know-that' knowledge but none of 'know-how' knowledge. The act of Mary 'seeing' colour for the first time means that she learns new 'know-how' knowledge which she did not have. Physicalism, as a result, is preserved as Mary only has 'know-that' knowledge so does not know all physical *facts* about colour perception.\n\nThis relies on three facts:\n1. There is a distinction between physical fact and physical knowledge\n1. There are unknowable physical facts that give rise to new experiences\n2. Know-how cannot be learned through know-that (e.g. reading and watching videos)\n\nBriefly, the conclusion that Frank Jackson posits is as follows:\n\n1. It is possible for someone to know all *physical* information there is to know about $x$, still *experiencing* the act of seeing colour will teach her something about $x$.\n2. Certain experiences (e.g. experiencing colour) still teach Mary something new. Then, this means that all physical information there is to know about $x$ do not completely describe *all* information about $x$.\n3. This contradicts the theory of physicalism: that everything, including mental states, has a physical explanation. Extending this argument: if we could know every physical detail about someone else's brain, one would still not understand what it is like to experience things for them (Nagel's Bat Argument).\n\nHowever, this conclusion relies heavily on the first premise being true, that is, it being possible for one to \"acquire ... all the physical information there is to obtain about what goes on when we see [$x$]\". Let us first examine the explicit distinction between 'physical knowledge' and 'physical facts' here.\n\nKnowledge, specifically, entails all 'knowable' things. In the context of this paper, I define 'knowledge' as justified true belief. Subject $S$ knows $x$ if and only if[^1]:\n\n1. $x$ is true\n2. $S$ believes that $x$\n3. $S$ is justified in believing that $x$.\n\nI posit that there are facts (read true statements about object $x$) that cannot be known, let alone proven. For example, let us imagine that it is a fact that aliens do not exist. As of now, we have no suitable methodology or measurements that would allow us to confirm this fact (this would involve an exhaustive search of the universe which, as far as we know, is impossible). Thus, the set of all true statements about object $x$ is equal to or larger than the set of all obtainable knowledge about $x$. To know all physical knowledge about $x$ then does not necessarily imply knowing all physical *facts* about something.\n\nSpecifically, we note that the original Mary's Room argument phrases knowing as knowing \"all the physical information *there is to obtain* about what goes on when we see [$x$]\" (emphasis added). Then, there may be some physical facts Mary may not know that contribute to her experience of experiencing 'yellowness' when seeing a banana for the first time that she may not have known ahead of time, despite her having complete physical knowledge of the banana. As a result, Mary *experiences* something new (namely, seeing yellow) but does not learn anything new.","lastmodified":"2022-02-15T20:23:08.88547976Z","title":"Knowledge Argument"},"/thoughts/Lindy-effect":{"content":"[Lindy Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect) -\u003e future life expectancy of a bit of technology is proportional to its current age (i.e. the longer something has survived, the more likely it is to have a longer remaining life expectancy).\n\nLongevity implies a resistance to change, obsolescence or competition and greater odds of continued existence into the future.\n\nMany traditional materials have the attractive property that they _look bad before they act bad_ and, furthermore, _the problems with traditional materials are well understood_.","lastmodified":"2022-02-15T20:23:08.88547976Z","title":"Lindy Effect"},"/thoughts/Making-and-Maintenance-of-OSS":{"content":"---\n\nFull post: [A case for funding Open Source](posts/paid-open-source.md)\n\n## Quotes\n### [Maintenance](thoughts/creation%20vs%20maintenance.md)\nA lot of initiatives like HacktoberFest are widely championed as 'good for open source' yet frequently cause maintainers to seize up with anxiety because such initiatives often attract low-quality contributors looking to snag a free t-shirt. \"Open source code is public, but it doesn't have to be participatory: maintainers can buckle under excess demand for their [attention](thoughts/attention%20economy.md)\"\n\nThis is akin to a writer being asked to edit and make changes to the same book every day, into perpetuity, long after they’ve reaped the initial financial and reputational rewards from its creation. What's more, unlike other content, open source code is relied upon by people, companies, and other institutions that need it to keep working, long after the maintainer's interest may have waned.\n\nWhen Richard Stallman first described free software as \"free as in speech, not free as in beer,\" the distinction he wished to make is that the term \"free\" referred to what one could do with the software, rather than to its price.\n\nThe common misconception of software is that it is often characterized as \"zero marginal cost,\" meaning that it can be distributed for nearly nothing, regardless of how many additional people consume it. The problem is not that simple. Code is nearly free to distribute, but maintenace can still be expensive. External contributions don't necessarily reduce the burden of maintenance either, because they still require someone to review and merge them.\n\nThe work of an open source developer goes beyond the initial costs of creation. Maybe developers can't help but make things, and share the things they make, but every time they do, and ever time they find success, a tiny, invisible clock begins to tick, and they're tasked with managing the care and feeding of their code into perpetuity.\n\n### Dependencies and [Infrastructure](thoughts/infrastructure.md)\nThere's even a term called the *bus factor*, where project health is a measured by the number of developers that would need to get hit by a bus before the project is in trouble.\n\nHowever, this 'theory' no longer matches up with empirical observation. In fact, less than 5% of developers were responsible for over 95% of code and social interactions on GitHub. The average software developer these days easily relies on hundreds of open source projects to write code these days, it's inevitable that they'll only be able to passively consume most of them.\n\nInfrastructure is recursively defined by public consensus. It's the set of structures that we've collectively decided are most valuable *in any given moment,* and, therefore, its boundaries and definitions are expected to change over time.\n\nLike a bridge that needs to support more traffic that it was built for, every social platform is scramlbing to upgrade its infrastructure to accommodate the volume of social interactions we're dealing with today. Platforms need to build skyscrapers where there were once villages.\n\n### Identity\nLike joining a club, it's not about how many times you've attending meetings but how you self-identify, and how others identify you, that makes you a 'member'. Some attendees might come every week for years and still not be considered part of the group.\n\n### Code as Content\nCode, like any other type of content available online today, is **trending toward modularity**: a mille-feuille layer cake of little libraries instead of one big, jiggling, Jell-O mold.\n\n\"Like a book or video, code is just a bunch of information, packaged up for distribution. But its role as a utility is more explicit.\"\n\nToday, \"content\" is better understood not as a thing we set out to make -- as an automaker might exist solely to produce cars -- but as \"an externality from [our] existing social systems.\" Content is a snapshot of our civilization.\n\n### Platforms and Governance\nA \"Benevolent Dictator for Life\" or BDFL for short, describes authors of open source projects who retain control even as the project grows. A great example of this is Linus Torvalds, who even after 14,000 unique contributors to the Linux kernel, still is the only person allowed to merge contributions into the main branch.\n\n\"Like a talent agency, platforms add value to creators by first improving their *distribution*, exposing them to potentially millions of people. ... This [feedback loop](thoughts/feedback%20loops.md) is [positive sum](thoughts/positive%20sum.md), encouraging more creators to join. So long as more people keep using the platform, there's no sense that any one creator will ever suck up all the oxygen in the room.\"\n\n###  Commons-based Peer Production\nThe economist Elinor Ostrom identified 8 design principles that contribute to a well-managed, succesful commons:\n1. Membership boundaries are clearly defined\n2. The rules that govern the commons should match the actual conditions\n3. Those who are affected by these rules can participate in modifying them\n4. Those who monitor the rules are either community members or are accountable to the community, rather than outsiders\n5. Those who violate the rules are subject to *graduated sanctions*, which vary depending on the seriousness and context of the offense\n6. Conflicts should be resolved within the community, using low-cost methods\n7. External authorities recognize the right of community members to devise their own institutions\n8.

They worry about instrumental reason becoming a model for good thinking. I take these fears seriously but do not see them as fears about computers themselves but rather as fears about hwo culture will assimilate the computer presence.\n\nRelevant to [AI systems](/posts/ai-systems)\nThe definition of artificial intelligence can be narrow or broad. In the narrow sense, AI is concerned with extending the capacity of machines to perform functions that would be considered intelligent if performed by people. Its goal is to construct machines, and, in doing so, it can be thought of as a branch of advanced engineering... In order to make a machine capable of learning, we have to probe deeply into the nature of learning. And from this kind of research comes the broader definition of artificial intelligence: that of cognitive science.\n\n\"The question to ask about the program is not whether it is right of wrong, but if it is fixable. If this way of looking at intellectual products were generalized to how the larger culture thinks about knowledge and its acquisition, we all might be less intimidated by our fears of 'being wrong.'\"\n\n### [Multiple realization](thoughts/multiple%20realization.md)\nMen have always been interested in flying. Once upon a time, scientists determined to understand how birds fly. First they watched them, hoping to correlate the motion of a bird's wings with its upward movement. Then they proceeded to experiment and found that when its feathers were plucked, a bird could no longer fly. Having thus determined that feathers were the organ of flight, the scientists then focused their efforts on microscopic and ultramicroscopic investigation of feathers in order to discover the nature of their flight-giving power.\n\n\"You have no reason to suppose that airplanes and birds work the same way -- birds have no propellors, airplanes have no feathers\"\n\n\"If we had to base our opinions on observation of how poorly children learned French in American schools, we would have to conclude that most people were incapable of mastering it. But we know that all normal children would learn it easily if they lived in France.\"\n\nIn retrospect, we know that the road that led from nineteenth-century transportation was quite different. The invention of the automobile and the airplane did not come from a detailed study of how their predecessors, such as horse-drawn carriages, worked or did not work.\n\n### Logical consistency in systems\nThe conflicts are regulated and kept in check rather than \"resolved\" through the intervention of special agents no less simple-minded than the original ones.

Casual co-working time.\n\n**Motivation for the search**: A group of us were chatting and one of my friends mentioned her undergraduate thesis on the concept of vibes as applied to fundamental essences of objects. I was curious if she had heard of the term 'qualia' before as the concepts seemed related. I keep a personal online archive of notes on my website and wanted to surface a relevant link that I read but couldn't remember off of the top of my head. Specifically, looking for this article from [Real Life Mag](https://reallifemag.com/nameless-feeling/?curius=1294).\n\n**Details of the search**: Search term: *qualia*, result was in the first three surfaced\n\n**Device type and Search Engine**: Mobile, site-specific search on my personal site (jzhao.xyz)\n\n**Was the search successful?** Finished within one session! Found the note I was looking for with the first query.\n\n**Reflection on the search:** This is a pretty good representation of the average use-case for searching through my own website. If done well, I have a **shareable representation of my thoughts** that I can send out into the world and access easily from any device anywhere.\n\nSearch is a pretty default entry point for me into my 'second-brain' (more on why in my post on [networked thought](posts/networked-thought.md)). I use search as an entry-point into a single node, then recall by associativity rather than by indexing. But having a good entry-point can make or break my flow into finding what I’m looking for. In this case, I had already known that this note existed in my garden so I just searched by the title of the note.\n\nBecause this search system is still rather brittle, I've learned to start splitting notes into atomic concepts with short, simple nouns like \"[qualia](thoughts/qualia.md)\" and \"[Chesterton's Fence](thoughts/Chesterton's%20Fence.md)\" rather than long winding descriptions, which helps me find and organize notes more easily. The engine operates on an extended version of the bag of words model and as such, I have adapted to mostly searching off of keywords rather than more \"natural language\".\n\n# Entry 2\n**Day, Time, and Location:** February 5th, 10:23pm EST, Montreal\n\n**How long did the search take?** ~30 minutes\n\n**Photo showing setting of the search:** No photo. Sitting at desk with a laptop, slightly groggy.\n\n**Motivation for the search**: I am currently working on a digital version of an essay that a collective of technologists I'm a part of is publishing soon. We are doing last minute polish around performance for lower-end devices that may not be able to handle a lot of the more performance-intensive graphics we have. \n\n**Details of the search**: A collection of searches with queries like \"three js gradient skybox\", \"ScissorCanvas effectcomposer\", and a huge string of other searches. Most results led me to issues on GitHub like https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/6022 and https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/5979.\n\n**Device type and Search Engine**: Laptop, Google + GitHub code search.\n\n**Was the search successful?** None of the search results were able to give me an exact answer but helped provide context into the history of the issue. For example, the second search result let me know that shaderpasses will use the wrong viewport/scissor for rendering if used in conjunction. I ended up using a slightly hacky workaround to achieve the same effect.\n\n**Reflection on the search:** I have had a decent amount of experience making technical searches in the past. A lot of programming *is* just knowing what combination of search terms will make Google spit out the most relevant search results. Most times, Google surfaces relevant and helpful pages and this was no exception. \n\nI tend to use search engines like Google very frequently. As a fast typer, my approach is to just stream words that surface from my head and iteratively refine and re-type queries as I visit and park pages (in the terminology of [information foraging](thoughts/information%20foraging.md), I rely heavily on behaviour enrichments and have a tight goal, forage, refine loop).\n\n# Entry 3\n**Day, Time, and Location:** February 4th, 2:56pm PST, Vancouver\n\n**How long did the search take?** ~5 minutes\n\n**Photo showing setting of the search:** No photo.

I had remembered seeing a very nice solarpunk-themed video commercial on YouTube somewhere but couldn't quite remember the right combination of search times to find it. I *did* remember that it was somehow a yoghurt commercial.\n\n**Details of the search**: Initial search was for \"yoghurt commercial\". After immediately realizing this was not specific enough, I asked in the Discord call if people remember the name of the company and then modified it to \"Chobani commercial solarpunk\" and finally \"Chobani commercial solarpunk but no product placement\" to remove all the product placement.\n\n**Was the search successful?** Eventually found the \"Dear Alice\" video that I was looking for! [Video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqJJktxCY9U)\n\n**Reflection on the search**: This was a really interesting example of search in a more 'collaborative' fashion. A lot of my information recall happens via association and the more people to help fill in gaps in memory, the faster I am able to find the thing I am looking for. This search in particular took two 'hops' of refinement.\n\n# Entry 4\n**Day, Time, and Location:** January 28th, 2:58pm PST, Vancouver\n\n**How long did the search take?** ~1 minute\n\n**Photo showing setting of the search:** No photo. At desk, messaging people on Facebook while eating a meal.\n\n**Motivation for the search**: One of my close friends has been experimenting with the concept of telescopic text (an example: https://www.telescopictext.org/text/KPx0nlXlKTciC). There was a really interesting interaction design experiment that one of my mutual friends on Twitter has been experimenting with that I wanted to share (this one in particular: https://twitter.com/azlenelza/status/1487153246531579905)\n\n**Details of the search**: I had remembered that I bookmarked this tweet reply at some point so the first place I looked was my Bookmarks tab in Twitter. Twitter's search is notoriously bad so I just scrolled chronologically and used cmd+f liberally until I found the tweet.\n\n**Was the search successful?** Yes!

In these cases, I rely heavily on interaction enrichments like using in-browser search and F-scanning (more on F-scanning: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content/) of the tweet profile pictures to quickly comb through content.

You've managed to survive; the forest itself isn't that bad. But, there's a pack of wolves that keeps trying to hunt you down, and every few days you have to run away from where you've set up camp. This is one of those days. You hear the howling of the wolves and run run run for it... until you break through the tree line and find yourself facing a massive ravine. There's clearly no way to jump, go around, or scale down it. Scanning frantically, you see a rope bridge about half a kilometer away, and you dash toward it. There seems to be some large boulder blocking the entrance, but you'll deal with that when you get there. As you approach, a long neck raises an elegant reptilian head, and two golden eyes turn to regard you. The boulder was a sleeping dragon! You slow down and approach with caution. Dragons are known to be intelligent and mostly benevolent; maybe you can just talk to them and ask them to move. \"Great dragon!,\" you call out. \"Please let me past you onto the bridge. There's a group of wolves coming after me, and I don't want to be eaten.\" The dragon looks askance at you, turns its long neck to look across the ravine, and turns back to you again. \"Bridge? What bridge?,\" they ask. \"The one right behind you,\" you reply, surprised. \"There's a bridge here?,\" the dragon queries, feigning (or not?) confusion. You're stunned. \"Yes, the bridge, it's right there!,\" you say. \"Aha!,\" says the dragon. \"But how do you know there's a bridge here? How can you be certain of what you see, that it's not an illusion, or that all of this isn't a dream?

The grasshopper, about to die for winter, leaves his disciples with a few riddles. Within these tales, the grasshopper details his philosophy of \"refusing to work and insisting upon devoting himself exclusively to play\". Of course, his disciples challenge him about this, leading to a journey of defining what games are, attitudes toward playing games, and the role of games in utopias. \n\n(When talking about why the author chose to write the book as a Platonic dialogue) \"His refusal to express himself in a plain expository style is perhaps no different in principle from someone's setting out to write an entire book without using the letter *e*\"\n\n## [Utopia](thoughts/utopia.md) and Scarcity\n\"For one cannot help reflecting that if there were no winters to guard against, then the Grasshopper would not get his come-uppance nor the ant his shabby victory. The life of the grasshopper would be vindicated and that of the ant absurd\"\n\n\"Thus, although time is a finite quantity for everyone, it is not a limited resource for everyone. For a bored person time is a burden; for a person on the rack it is agony. And when time *is* a resource for someone it is not always a limited resource. For a person with very few goals there is always enough time to accomplish all of them.\"\n\n\"[Play](thoughts/play.md) is necessary but not sufficient adequately to account for the ideal of existence\"\n\n## A post-work society\nLet us imagine that all of the instrumental activities of human beings have been eliminated. All of the things ordinarily called work are now done by wholly automated machines which are activated solely by mental telepathy, so that not even a minimum staff is necessary for the housekeeping chores of society.\n\n\"You talk as though there were but two possible alternatives: either a life devoted exclusively to play or a life devoted exclusively to work. But most of us realize that our labour is valuable because it permits us to play, and we are presumably seeking to achieve some kind of balance between work input and play output. People are not, and do not want to be, wholly grasshoppers or wholly ants, but a combination of the two; people are and want to be (if you will forgive a regrettably vulgar but spooneristically inevitable construction) asshoppers or grants. We can, of course, all cease to work, but if we do then we cannot play for long either, for we will shortly die.\"\n\n### Art and Pursuit of Knowledge\nArt has a subject matter which consists in the actions and passions of humanity: with human aspirations and frustrations, hopes and fears, triumphs and tragedies, with flaws of character, moral dilemmas, joy and sorrow. But it would seem that none of these necessary ingredients of art could exist in Utopia, thus there are no artists of any sort in Utopia.\n\nThe acquisition of knowledge, just like the acquisition of anything else, is an instrumental process; that is acquisition is instrumental to possession, no matter what it is. We must therefore assume that all Utopians have acquired all the knowledge there is. Thus, there are no scientists, philosophers, or any other intellectual investigators.\n\nWe can call this state of affairs the **Alexandrian Condition of Man**, after Alexander the Great. When there are no more worlds to conquer, we are not filled with satisfaction but with despair.\n\nThus in Utopia, we need therefore is some activity in which what is instrumental is inseparably combined with what is intrinsically valuable, and where the activity is not itself is not itself an instrument for some further end: games. Games have obstacles which we can strive to overcome *just so that* we can possess the activity as a whole (playing the game).\n\nThe counter-argument though, is the existence of individuals value the means as much as the ends themselves, if not more. Once a scientist or philosopher after great effort solves a major problem he is very let down, and far from rejoicing in the possession of his solution or discovery, he cannot wait to be engaged once more in the quest. **Success is something to shoot at, not to live with**. This seems to dismantle the previous argument dismissing art and pursuit of knowledge as important in a post-work society.\n\nThe resolution to this appears to be the fact that activities which from one point of view be seen as instrumentally valuable can, from another point of view, be intrinsically valuable. For example, we can agree that carpentry is an instrumental activity; that is, instrumental to the existence of houses. But to a person who enjoys building for its own sake, that otherwise instrumental activity has intrinsic value as well. The same could be true of anyone who really enjoys their work, whatever that work might be. I then posit this type of work *as game playing* so thus can exist in Utopia.\n\nEven in a purely abundant world, one can *create* scarcity for themselves through imposing constraints [constitutive rules]. The dedicated puzzle solver will say, \"Don't tell me the answer; let me work it out for myself.\" Even if other means for coming to know the answer are readily available, he voluntarily rejects these means so that he will have something to do. This is definition of game playing.\n\nWhereas our own culture is based on various kinds of scarcity -- economic, moral, scientific, erotic -- the culture of Utopia will be based on plentitude and abundance. A utopic society would not study economics but rather [agalmics](thoughts/positive%20sum.md).\n\n## Games\nDefinitions:\n1. \"Let us say that games are goal-directed activities in which inefficient means are intentionally chosen.\"\n2. \"A game is an activity in which observance of rules is part of the end of the activity, and where such rules are non-ultimate; that is, where other rules can always supersede. the game rules; that is, where the player can always stop playing the game\"\n\nThen, to play a game is to attempt to achieve a specific state of affairs [prelusory goals], using only means permitted by rules [lusory means], where the rules prohibit the use of more efficient in favour of less efficient means [constitutive rules], and where the rules are accepted just because they make possible such activity possible [lusory attitude] (this is to say that rules are sufficient to make possible a game but not required). Simplified, **playing a game is the voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles.**\n\n\"Rules in games thus seem to be in some sense inseparable from ends, for to break a game rule (a means) is to render impossible the attainment of an end.\"\n\n\"In anything but a game the gratuitous introduction of unnecessary obstacles to the achievement of an end is regarded as a decidedly irrational thing to do, whereas in games it appears to be an absolutely essential thing to do.\"\n\nGames which are competitive (read: telic) involve winning and losing -- that is the aim or end of the game in the first place. The win of one implies the loss of another, a [zero sum](thoughts/zero%20sum.md) world. Playing, though, are the means which are ends themselves; the act of playing is enough and paratelic in nature. Thus, someone who plays games as an end is autotelic.\n\n\u003e Do you like the act of climbing the mountain or just being at the top? Because the latter doesn't require the first.\n\nGames, simply put, reverse the ends and means of other activities. In Kant's *Critique of Aesthetic Judgment*, he likens aesthetic experience to play as a kind of 'purposiveness without purpose' \n\n### Open and Closed Games\n- **Open games**: system of reciprocally enabling moves whose purpose is the continued operation of the system.\n- **Closed games**: games which have an inherent goal whose achievement ends the game. e.g. crossing a finish line, mating a king, etc.\n\nDisagreement in games then, usually comes from the disagreement over whether a certain game is open or closed.\n\n\"We might expect societies which place a high value on success through co-operation to be more inclined to emphasize open games\"\n\n### Distinction between rules and goals\nIt is possible to follow the rules of chess [the institution] without playing chess [the game]. On the contrary, one cannot play chess without following the rules (to do so is to be a cheat).\n\n### Terminology\n- Prelusory goals: specific achievable state of affairs. They can be described before, or independently of, any game of which it may be, or come to be, a part.\n- Lusory goals: winning the game. Game specific.\n- Lusory means: means which are permitted (legal or legitimate) in the attempt to achieve prelusory goals.\n- Constitutive rules: rules which prohibit use of the most efficient means for reaching a prelusory goal.\n- Lusory attitude: the acceptance of constitutive rules just so the activity made possible by such acceptance can occur.\n\n### Lusory Attitude -- the game attitude\nThe element which unifies the other elements into a single formula which successfully states the necessary and sufficient conditions for any activity to be an instance of game playing. The elements of game are\n1. The goal\n2. The means of achieving the goal\n3. The rules\n4.

Maintenance: \"surfaces problems with existing systems and attempts to mitigate those harms (for instance, by making them more fair, accountable, and transparent)\"\n\n\"When designers of these algorithmic systems train computational models that ignore transgender identity, these systems demand that trans people somehow shed an identity they can't; identities that cisgender people hardly ever bother to regard.\"\n\n\"Designers of sociotechnical systems have repeatedly built computational systems and models rendering decisions that exacerbate and reinforce historical prejudices, oppression, and marginalization\"\n\nFor those of us who can just *not* deal with race, or gender, or sexuality, we get to pass through these systems relatively unscathed. But for those of us who can't ignore those dimensions of who we are, those aspects of ourselves make us stick out. More examples in [Design Justice](thoughts/Design%20Justice.md).\n\n## [Utopia](thoughts/utopia.md)\nA utopia implies perfection and thus no feedback. ML models think they live in a perfect world unless told otherwise.\n\nRelated: [The ones who walk away from Omelas](thoughts/The%20ones%20who%20walk%20away%20from%20Omelas.md)\n\n## '[Truth](thoughts/truth.md)' and [Feedback loops](thoughts/feedback%20loops.md)\n\"Absurdity follows when algorithmic systems deny the people they mistreat the status to lodge complaints, let alone the power to repair, resist, or escape the world that these systems create.\" How do [feedback loops](thoughts/feedback%20loops.md) play into these systems? Is it possible to create good human-in-the-loop ML?\n\n\"Absurdity and tragedy tend to manifest when bureaucratic imaginations diverge from reality and when people can't override the delusions baked into those imaginations\" It's dangerous when a single source dictates the truth.\n\nBut when the institution *does* wield power and people can't just leave anymore, these institutions can (and do) get more and more detached from the lives and needs of people. Those bureaucracies construct their own worlds where everything gets \"rationalized\" in simplified, reductive language.\n\n\"People talk about \"debiasing\" data and reviewing code before a model is trained and deployed.\nWhat I'm saying is that even if you've done everything right, if you don't pay attention to the power dynamics as they unfold and play out, the system out in the world is going to drift further and further away from reality.\"\n\nSystemized classification and quantification of the world acts as an interpretive and transformational force. In other words, [quantization](thoughts/quantization.md) change the world.\n\nWhy monopolies (over data and power) are bad: bureaucracies with no power self-correct (or be corrected) -\u003e they have no place in a world where people can freely walk away or reject the bureaucracy's nonsense (give feedback)\n\n## Abridged Maps\nAbridged maps as [potemkin villages](thoughts/potemkin%20village.md), producing a simplified yet inaccurate view of the world. It's not necessarily wrong to create 'abridged maps', the problem comes when projecting the map onto the world to try and create change.\n\n\"When modelers and designers of influential systems use these maps as guides to substantially transform the world, the abridgements and the omissions they make become targets of erasure.\"\n\n\"In the process of training a model, the algorithm creates its own world -- it generates its own sort of utopia where things are clear and calculable. That system imposes its model upon the world, judging and punishing people who don't fit the model that the algorithm produced in the interest of some ostensibily objective goal that designers insist is better than decisions humans make in some or many ways.\"\n\nThese systems become more actively dangerous when they go from \"making sense of the world\" to \"making the world make sense\"\n\nThere's no dataset in the world that adequately conveys white supremacy, or slavery, or colonialism. (see: [data distributions](thoughts/data%20distributions.md))\n\nSo at best these systems generate a facsimile of a world with the shadows of history cast on the ground skewed, flattened, and always lacking depth that only living these experiences can bring.

Mostly the result of the Cold War and the military-industrial complex and the power of Stanford -- these two were not completely separate.\n\nA lot of military funding went to the west (and to California and thus Stanford). Big result of Fred Terman (Dean of Engineering at the time): \"let’s remake Stanford so that it’s a perfect receptacle for this new money. We are a true Cold War university.\"\n\nThe military-industrial complex rose as a result of the Cold War, showing how a capitalist democracy can be 'triumphant' over more socialist policies. As a result, a lot of government money went to private defense contractors (think Lockheed). When the Space Race came along, a lot of that money went to places specializing in small, light, powerful devices (microchips, integrated circuirts), and this happened to be Silicon Valley.\n\nGovernment wasn't the sole reason this explosion happened, rather more of \"a customer, as a catalyst, as a kind of de facto venture capitalist at an early stage, when there was no commercial market for this stuff.\"\n\n\u003e To have such mobilization around this massive effort, you do probably need some sort of geopolitical catalyst. It’s hard for it to be purely commercial...  **That’s the thing that can catalyze people, government, and resources into doing these big things.**\n\nProblem is that this 'urgency' needs to be bipartisan -- this was very difficult when the Soviet Union was widely feared. As a result, anything even mildly centrist is perceived as socialist -\u003e https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULYWIDcUOY4\n\nAbstraction of the problem\n\nAntipathy that the Valley has had towards the government is kind of like, \"Well it doesn’t have anything to do with us, if they could stay as far away as possible it would be good.\" -- tech is political\n\n## Democratic Capitalism\nDemocratic capitalism and the ability for people to protest what their government is doing.\n\nHistorically, white-collar tech workers in industry have been very OK with whatever their companies are doing as long is it gives them a comfy lifestyle -- yet now people are starting to question it.\n\nSo much of the technical expertise that used to be distributed across industry and government is now just in industry. This inbalance means that government agencies like the Pentagon and CIA need to go to these big tech companies to build good tech.\n\n## Blue-sky Operations\n\"Spending money on moonshots, whether metaphorical or real, is kind of something only the government can do.\"\n\nExamples like DARPA, investing in technology that is at least a few decades away from being commercializable or being something the military could possibly use.\n\nPersonal Computing? Moving away from establishments having all the computing power and giving power back to the individual user. \"We’re going to create these devices, take them, and build computers of our own that are apart from this corporate military-industrial business.\"\n\nTo tell a company that is accountable to shareholders and quarterly earnings calls, “Okay, the moonshot’s on you guys,” is not so great.\n\n### Sandbox Model\n\"Throw a lot of money in its direction and get out of the way\" Create the sandbox, an incredible container with lots of resources in it, and allow creative people to play around in the sand and see what they develop. Naturally very incompatible with political traditions in other places.\n\n### Moonshot People and Immigration\nPeople like Andy Grove who later becomes the CEO of Intel, come into the country as teenage refugees from places like Hungary where the immigration officers probably thought he would be a 'drain on the system'.\n\nBut then you have winners of one generation picking the winners of the next, creating a very self-reinforcing [feedback loop](thoughts/feedback%20loops.md).

The network existed in some relational sense between enterprises, but because DB's were so fragile they never spoke directly to the network because then they broke. Even if you did connect DBs somewhat directly, the DB encodes the worldview of the organization and different organizations have different worldviews, so the DBs can't speak to each other clearly.\"\n\n**There were no large-scale computer-to-computer connections that allowed us to create a shared world view between lots of different organizations**.\n\n\u003e This is the promise of blockchains -- to create a global 'distributed database'\n\nThe goal is to build a single, shared story of reality, spread across all the machines simultaneously. And when it changes in one place, it changes everywhere.\n\n### Thoughts\nThe part about no more 'storing stuff' and 'sending stuff' I always find interesting because 'storing' stuff still happens to be on the public ledger. The only difference now is that there is a distinction between sending metadata (which you tell someone to just refer to a piece of data on chain) and sending information (transferring ownership).\n\nWaiting for the day web3 projects get large enough to amortize and offset the gas fees that consumers pay now (much like centralized orgs nowadays front hosting costs for 'free' tier or the average consumer).\n\n### Act II -- Smart Contracts\n\"First we merged the network and the database in a blockchain.

Despite this distinction, we know 'this' is only imagined and arises from the self.\n\t- Consciousness, when this happens, does not become the elephant, nor does it cease to exist as the 'I' when taking on the elephant's form, it simplify manifests itself as something distinct from the 'this'.\n\t- This plasticity is what the Śaivas call \"freedom\"\n- Internality is the reflective awareness 'I', externality is the reflective awareness 'this'\n\t- For objects perceived there are two kinds of externality\n\t\t1.

Usability goals are primarily objective, user experience goals are more subjective.\n\n### Usability Goals\nUsability refers to ensuring that interactive products are easy to learn, effective to use, and enjoyable from the user's perspective. Following 6 goals:\n\n1. Effective to use (effectiveness). Is the product capable of allowing people to learn, carry out their work efficiently, access the information that they need, or buy the goods that they want?\n2. Efficient to use (efficiency). Once users have learned how to use a product to carry out their tasks, can they sustain a high level of productivity?\n3. Safe to use (safety). What is the range of errors that are possible using the product, and what measures are there to permit users to recover easily from them?\n4. Having good utility (utility). Does the product provide an appropriate set of functions that will enable users to carry out all of their tasks in the way they want to do them?\n5. Easy to learn (learnability). Is it possible for the user to work out how to use the product by exploring the interface and trying certain actions? How hard will it be to learn the whole set of functions in this way? Should have good transfer effects (where knowledge acquired earlier improves one's ability to learn/perform in another context)\n6. Easy to remember how to use (memorability). What types of interface support have been provided to help users remember how to carry out tasks, especially for products and operations they use infrequently?\n\nExamples of commonly used usability criteria\n-   time to complete a task (efficiency)\n-   time to learn a task (learnability)\n-   number of errors made when carrying out a task over time (memorability)\n\n### User Experience Goals\nThese are concerned with how users experience an interactive product from their perspective, rather than assessing how useful or productive a system is from its own perspective\n\nDesirable aspects of UX\n- Satisfying\n- Enjoyable\n- Helpful\n- Fun\n- Provocative\n\nUndesirable aspects of UX\n- Making one feel stupid or guilty\n- Cutesy\n- Gimmicky\n- Frustrating\n\nThese are combined in a user's multi-faceted experience of a product\n\n### Design Principles\n\u003e Generalizable abstractions intended to orient designers toward thinking about different aspects of their designs\n\nConcerned with what users should see and do when carrying out their tasks using an interactive product: the dos and don'ts of interaction design.\n\n1. High visibility: ensure functions are easy to find and intuitive.\n2. Feedback: time sensitive information about what actions has been done and what has been accomplished.\n3. Constraints: ways of restricting the user interaction to those which are valid in any given moment.\n4. Consistency: an interface which follows rules, such as using the same operation to select all objects.\n5. Affordance: attributes should obviously signal what they can use it for. Afford means \"to give a clue\"\n\nThe problem when applying these to real world is that trade-offs can arise between principles (e.g. increased constraint might mean less visibility).","lastmodified":"2022-02-15T20:23:08.889479792Z","title":"Design Goals"},"/thoughts/design-requirements":{"content":"Two main 'diamonds' of diverge-converge, one to find the right problem and the other to find the right solution (fulfilling human needs).\n\n![Double-Diamond Model: Discover, define, develop, deliver](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Double_diamond.png)*Discover, define, develop, deliver*\n\n![Interaction Design Lifecycle](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andre-Andre-8/publication/327907730/figure/fig1/AS:675449290100740@1538051068743/Interaction-Design-Lifecycle-Model.ppm)\n\nThe 4 basic activities for interaction design are as follows:\n1. Discovering requirements (discover/define phase). Deciding what to design is key, and exploring the problem space is one way to decide. The goal is understanding the target users and the support an interactive product could provide.\n2. Designing alternatives (develop phase). This can be 2 parts, conceptual design (producing the conceptual model of the product) or concrete design (detail of the product like colours, sounds, images, etc.)\n3. Prototyping alternative designs to be communicated and assessed (develop phase). The process of designing behaviour of interactive products as well as look and feel. Doesn't necessarily need working software!\n4. Evaluating the product and the UX it offers (develop phase). Determine the usability and acceptability of the product or design measured in terms of a variety of usability and user-experience criteria.\n\nHere are a few good questions to ask to better understand the problem:\n-   what are the human needs?\n-   who are the stakeholders?\n-   what are the central tasks?\n-   what might we want to learn? (evaluation goals)\n-   who should our participants be?\n\n## Requirements\nRequirements are **stable** descriptions of users' aspirations, goals, constraints, expectations etc that form a sound basis from which to start design activities (not rigid, might shift over long periods of time). They are also statements about an intended product that specifies what it is expected to do or how it will perform.\n\nDiscovering and communicating reqs is important bc defining what needs to be built supports technical developers and allows users to contribute more effectively\n\n### Steps\n1.  identify **human needs**\n-   which the proposed interactive system will support; task, goals, conditions; current problems and strengths\n2.  identify all **users and other stakeholders**\n-   who do or perform the activity: groups, capabilities, motives, needs\n3.  set **levels of support (metrics)**\n-   functionalities the system will provide; environmental constraints and user/stakeholder characteristics\n-   metrics: how we know if we have succeeded → can be quantitative or qualitative\n-   fit criterion is something that can be used to assess when the solution meets the requirement\n\n### Kinds\n1. **functional requirements:** describe what the product will do\n2.  **nonfunctional requirements:** describe the characteristics (sometimes called constraints) of the product\n\t1.  **data requirements:** capture type, volatility, size/amount, persistence, accuracy, and value of required data\n\t\t-   eg. app for buying/selling stocks has to have up-to-date and accurate data which is likely to change many times a day\n\t2.  **environmental requirements:** context of use; circumstances in which the interactive product will operate. made up of:\n\t\t1.  **physical environment:** lighting, noise, movement, dust expected in operational environment. Will users need to wear protective clothing, which may affect the choice of interface type?\n\t\t2.  **social environment**: will data need to be shared? does sharing have to be synchronous or async?\n\t\t3.  **organizational environment**: how good is user support likely to be, how easily is it obtained, how efficient or stable is the communication infrastructure, etc?\n\t\t4.  **technical environment**: what tech will the product run on or need to be compatible with, and what technological limitations might be relevant?\n\t3.  **user characteristics:** capture key attributes of user group. collection of characteristics for a typical user is a **user profile**\n\t\t-   eg. abilities and skills, educational background, preference, personal circumstances, disabilities, novice/expert/casual or frequent user etc\n\t4.  **usability goals and user experience goals**\n\t\t-   **usability engineering:** approach in which specific measures for usability goals are agreed upon early in the dev process and used to track progress","lastmodified":"2022-02-15T20:23:08.889479792Z","title":"Double Diamond Model of Design"},"/thoughts/desire-paths":{"content":"\u003e The path usually represents the shortest or most easily navigated route between an origin and destination.

They are public spaces where a lot of people coincidentally share the same space for a short period in time. It has the same energy as commuting -- a familiar yet ever-changing context.\n\nThe park and the trees may stay the same most times you visit yet the people on the benches and walking on the paved paths are always different. One can sit and observe all the people moving by, [wondering what their life is like.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People-watching).\n\n\u003e \"What would it look like to do that with your favourite internet neighbourhoods?\"\n\nThis is a small reflection on potential new avenues to explore for digital spaces. Not to say that any existing ones are bad but I am interested to see what new direction we can take to explore how we use technology to further human connection.\n\n### Serendipity in Public Spaces\nSerendipity is bumping into new people you otherwise wouldn't have talked to or sought out. It's the casual bus or subway chatter, the queue neighbour, or stranger reading on a park bench. It's the opposite of intentionality.\n\nAre there ways to be _less_ intentional with digital interactions?\n\nIf you want to meet with someone you need to schedule it or visit a link, etc. There is no 'random' interaction. Even algorithmic experiences are like being carried away by the TikTok or Facebook algorithm rather than something out of the blue. Though these experiences may seem random at times, they are explicitly currated with an _end goal_ in mind.\n\nAre there any spaces that don't have ulterior motives and are just places of gathering? The only example that comes to mind where 'coincidental' interaction happen is within currated [interest groups](thoughts/social%20graphs.md) like onlike network forums around games or technologies or early communities lead by superconnectors like the [Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link (WELL)](thoughts/From%20Counterculture%20to%20Cyberculture.md). How can we recreate these public 'watering holes' for people to gather around? \n\n### Permanence in Private Spaces\nPermance means that the environment reflects that people have been there. A shared garden to tend to, a bookshelf to work through, a guestbook of all the people who have dropped in and out.\n\nSo many of our mediums have now tended towards [real time](thoughts/ephemereal%20content.md) in an effort to replicate the fleeting nature of face-to-face conversation; vanishing messages, video chats, and audio rooms. Yet, rarely do any of these platforms leave any indication whether a conversation ever happened between two people.\n\nIs there any way we can create shared *artifacts* that are permanent and can be grown over time? A digital indication that a space is lived in and occupied?\n\nAs of now, most platforms keep a primative chat log or history but thats it. What if there was a way to create digital [gardens](https://twitter.com/samihusseni/status/1329499588982575104) to foster and maintain existing relationships? A commonspace you could both take care of, share, and contribute to. Completely private common spaces often allow users to put whatever and allow people can construct their own digital nooks and cozy spaces.\n\nMaybe this involves having a shared calendar, todo list, books. Or even just a space to co-live and co-exist in [virtual worlds](thoughts/virtual%20worlds.md). Most online RPG games (think Animal Crossing, Minecraft, Stardew valley) give the option for users to have a shared space to exist and build together (and where both people don't necessarily both need to be present for the space to function). Why doesn't this exist outside of the gaming sphere?\n\nCan we create permanence of artifacts without sacrificing ephemerality in medium?\n\n## Tools for Digital Spaces\nGiven that there are so many different types of digital spaces, I wanted to explore how different tools are supporting and facilitating different sorts of digital human interaction. Can we use urban planning to help us [plan digital spaces](https://medium.com/@jasminewsun/jane-jacobs-social-media-83b4265a1d12)?\n\nThe hope is to be able to move away from the 'feed'-based model of browsing the social internet and to create safe spaces to interact at different scales.\n\n\u003e The “feed”–an archaic form of content consumption that is effectively just a direct visual manifestation of the data structure that powers it – is a medium that is effectively designed to be consumed alone.  --[Humphrey Obuobi](https://www.somewheregood.com/garden/trust-and-safety/)\n\n### Town Square\nMany-to-many relationships like clubs, families, larger interest groups. \n\n#### Questions\n* How do we ensure that people feel connected in large groups and find \nwhat they are looking for?\n* Should communities be gated or public?

The result was the centralization and consolidation of the Internet — the true y2k tragedy. This tragedy unfolded in stages, a gradual infringement of rights: users had to first be made transparent to their internet service providers, and then they were made transparent to the internet services they used, and finally they were made transparent to one another. The intimate linking of users' online personas with their offline legal identity was an iniquitous squandering of liberty and technology that has resulted in today's atmosphere of accountability for the citizen and impunity for the state.

Homo economicus: The most common behavioral model assumes that humans are atomic individuals who operate rationally and selfishly.  We know now that humans have limited attention, are contextually altruistic, are highly [tribe flourishing](thoughts/tribe%20flourishing.md), and exhibit a wide range of irrational cognitive biases.\n2. Individuals are the best judge of their needs: Our brains are not conscious of the base psychological processes driving some of our most pressing needs and are thus unable to value relationships rationally.\n3. Weak social modeling: Most economics models ignore basic human behavior such as friendship networks, affiliation networks, limits on cognitive resources (ex: attention) or altruism.\n\nEconomics embraces reductive utilitarianism and posits you can put a price on anything.

These simply don’t tell us much about what motivates players to play. If I were to build the game again, I would have implemented the togetherness metric for the very first private alpha.\n\nA lot of pedagogy is covers the same questions as game design (especially tutorials): how much explicit guidance should a student/player get in an activity?\n\nThe \"[vow of silence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrDZ--AuiL8)\": to preserve the joy of discovery, games should carefully structure their activities so that players will learn what they need through [play](thoughts/play.md). An approach very similar to the [constructionist](thoughts/constructionist.md) ones found in [Mindstorms](thoughts/Mindstorms.md)\n\nThe goal is to give users/players the freedom to manage their own position relative to their own intellectual \"sweet spot\"\n\n![](/thoughts/images/flow.png)\n\n## [Economics](thoughts/economics.md) and [Game Theory](thoughts/game%20theory.md)\n[Source: Prosocial economics for game design by *Daniel Cook*](https://lostgarden.home.blog/2020/01/11/prosocial-economics-for-game-design-%EF%BB%BF/)\n\n\u003e Multiplayer games can help build a player’s social support network. What would game design look like if our goals included **reducing loneliness**, **decreasing toxicity** and boosting a player’s **positive connections** with others?\n\n### Loneliness\nThe loneliness epidemic is a real thing. It has been medically associated with mortality, depression, and more. In aggregate, chronic loneliness is estimated to shorten lifespan by an average of 15 years.\n\nAdvancing age also makes us more likely to be lonely. Especially as we work on [longevity](thoughts/longevity.md) research, this is a pressing issue to try to solve.\n\nThe best games are designed to be played with [friends](thoughts/friendship.md).\n\n### Toxicity\n\u003e At the root of much toxicity is the misdirection of our human need to belong\n\nWhen humans feel like they lack membership in healthy, eudaimonic, organizations, they experience stress and seek to rapidly remedy the situation (e.g. lashing out at others in hopes that putting others down helps them rise in status).\n\nIn toxic systems every new user is potentially rewarded if they adopt toxic behaviours.\n\n### Prosocial Game Design\nThree main pitfalls\n1. Psychology: there are a lot of requirements to build friendships, like right sized groups of people, correct density, and engagement in mutually dependent reciprocal activities.\n2. Logistics: rigid human limits on how many relationships they can maintain and how long it takes them to form new ones (see: [group limits](thoughts/group%20limits.md))\n3. Economics: games are built on an economic foundation of resources (creation, transformation, trade, and consumption). However, it is hard to get economic incentives to align with those of social behaviour. \"In particular, many of the key elements required by the psychological and logistical aspects of friendship formation are systematically undervalued within common economic practices.\"\n\n### Boundaries between the real world and the [virtual world](thoughts/virtual%20worlds.md)\nThere’s limited permeability of the boundary between the real world and the cartoon world. You can think of this as the designer writing out the import / export laws for their bubble of play\n\n### Elements of the internal economy\n- Tokens: base units of quantity (can represent attention, time, or value). They act as goods, products, or currencies\n- Sources: operations that produce new tokens\n- Pools: stores of tokens\n- Sinks: operations that take tokens out of circulation\n- Transforms: transform one type of token into another\n\nThen agents who perform operations:\n- Players: human agents who trigger various transforms, sources, and sinks\n- [Black Box](thoughts/black%20box.md): computer agents or systems which also trigger transforms, sources, and sinks. Often, players attempt to understand the triggers of this black box.\n\nFrom these, we can model various phenomena like [feedback loops](thoughts/feedback%20loops.md) and ownership\n\nWe can then use these to influence [incentive](thoughts/incentives.md) structures to balance games (e.g. improve a drop rate of a weapon to better increase the rate at which a key boss is defeated)\n\nExamples of internal economic systems:\n- Leveling Systems: XP tokens\n- Items: enables players to perform various transforms on the pool (e.g. a weapon is a token which depletes enemy health tokens to generate XP tokens)\n- Chat: budget of attentional and time resources\n\n### Prosocial Values\n- Friendship: The formation and maintenance of healthy, meaningful friendship networks between players. \n- Thriving individuals: Individuals feel competence, volition, and relatedness, both for themselves and for their friends. \n- Altruism: The promotion of activities that involve intrinsically motivated altruism and cooperation. \n- Positive group norms: The spread and enforcement of shared altruistic social norms within and across groups.\n- Shared goals: The definition and adoption of shared group goals. Players work towards those goals via mutual interdependence, and achieve feelings of purpose and meaningfulness. \n\nAnti-values\n- Individual Toxicity: poorly socialized individuals resort to antisocial behaviours in an attempt to put themselves above the group.\n- Group Toxicity: intergroup friction results in unhealthy interactions\n- Loneliness: sparse relationship networks, we feel this when our social support network fails. Loneliness tells us that our current social situation is untenable long term and we should seek out connection with others.\n\n### Measuring Trust\n[Trust](thoughts/trust.md) is an internal factor that cannot be measured directly so instead we need to rely on proxies.\n1. Pairwise bonds: There are two different (_asymmetric_) bonds for any given pair of player; the bond player A to player B and the bond from player B to player A.\n2. Active time spent together: One of the easiest symmetric bond proxies is simply tracking if players are in the same area together. \n3. Success together in high trust situations\n4. Time spent talking positively to each other\n\nHowever, this 'trust value' should not be public for the sake of avoiding converting it into a metric to optimize for: [Goodhart's Law](thoughts/Goodhart's%20Law.md). Doing so may transform relationships into ones which are transactional in nature with clear extrinsic motivators in the form of your willingness to make that number go up or down. (This is also one of the reasons why ‘likes’ in social media end up being a source of toxicity and in general a very poor practice.)\n\nOne also needs to keep in mind that trust differs across social contexts\n\nFor new players, one of the scariest things is requirement to engage in specialized, high coordination group performances. Building towards high trust using a ladder:\n![](/thoughts/images/trust-ladder.png)\n\n### [Positive Sum](thoughts/positive%20sum.md) Resources\nAn economy of zero sum resources is a world of scarcity. The challenge economics attempts to solve is how we might split up these limited resources in an efficient fashion.\n\nIn [virtual worlds](thoughts/virtual%20worlds.md), we can make almost any resource positive sum. When a monster drops loot for one player, it can also drop loot for any other player that did damage.\n\nHowever, truly abundant worlds are not super fun to play in. How can we design for infinite source and imbalanced economies?\n- Per players caps: cap number of harvestable positive sum resources per player\n- Per group caps: cap total number of harvestable items per group of players\n- Transaction costs: can prevent global pooling with large transaction taxes. This encourages local resource use\n- Appropriate sinks: find ways to drain resources out of the world","lastmodified":"2022-02-15T20:23:08.893479824Z","title":"Game Design"},"/thoughts/game-theory":{"content":"[Source: The Evolution of Trust by *Nicky Case*](https://ncase.me/trust/)\n\nFor [trust](thoughts/trust.md) to evolve:\n1. Repeat interactions must happen. Trust keeps a relationship going, but you need the knowledge of possible future interactions *before* trust can evolve\n2. Possible win-win situations. This must be a [positive sum](thoughts/positive%20sum.md) game where *both* players can be better off\n3. Low miscommunication. High-tolerance players are possible but if the level of miscommunication is too high (low signal to noise ratio), trust breaks down. Even in low miscommunication situations, it pays to be more forgiving\n\nIn the short run, the rules of the game define what the players do. In the long run, players define the rules. Incentive for us to build the environment and rules we want to play in.\n\nUnfortunately, modern day social media means we have less 'close-friends' and thus repeat interactions than ever. With algorithmic news feeds, miscommunication breeds and win-win situations become scarce.\n\n## Applied Game Theory\nGame theory feels hard to apply to the real world due to properties like the [Collingridge Dilemma](thoughts/catch%2022.md)\n\nGames, however, are a great test bed for a lot of game theory given how information rich they are.

What does good/bad moderation look like? (posts/comments/membership)\n\nI think a key part of answering this is trying to define what role a community occupies. Is it just a collection of people gathering around a shared identity? Or is it supposed to be a platform for moderated idea discussion/generation? Or something else in between.\n\nThinking about this at the [infrastructure](/thoughts/infrastructure) level too, if a community's purpose is to serve as infrastructure so that it enables conversations, should infrastructure be regulated/enforced or something that should just play out naturally?\n\nBroadly defined, I see moderation as having two main categories: moderation of users and moderation of content. Moderation then, is to ensure that the set of values that is being conveyed by the users/content roughly aligns with that of the group/community.\n\nModeration of users involves regulating the *membership* of individuals within the community whereas moderation of content regulates what can/can't be said in the community.\n\nModeration gets problematic when it is used to target and discriminate against individuals because of personal relations or vendettas. I was thinking about also saying it becomes problematic when it discriminates against characteristics but I'm hesitant on this bit. Is it categorically different to exclude people who are misogynistic vs those of a certain race?

If an affordance or anti-affordance cannot be perceived, some means of signaling its presence is required.\n2. **Signifiers**: signifies *where* actions should occur. A mark, sound, or perceivable indicator that communicates appropriate behaviour to a person. Can be a [desire paths](thoughts/desire%20paths.md), a push/pull label, etc. However, we shuld be aware that different cultures associate different meanings with different signifiers.\n3. **Constraints**: limits to the possible interactions with an object. For example, the different sized holes in a scissor suggests different numbers of fingers may fit in each hole and not any more.\n4. **Mappings**: relationship between the elements of two sets of things. For example, a mapping of light switches to light bulbs or the steering wheel to the direction of the wheels. Groupings and proximity are important principles from Gestalt psychology that can be used to map controls to function: related controls should be grouped together. \n5. **Feedback**: communicating the results of an action or some way of letting you know that the system is working on your request. Has to be a balance, little and poor feedback and too much feedback can also be unhelpful and annoying to users. Feedback is essential, but not when it gets in the way of other things, including a calm and relaxing environment.","lastmodified":"2022-02-15T20:23:08.893479824Z","title":"Human Centered Design (HCD)"},"/thoughts/human-computer-interaction":{"content":"\u003e Better HCI is better empathy\n\nWhat even is HCI?\n* The human-machine joint performance of tasks\n* Human-computer or human-human communication mediated by computers\n\nMany a clever invention has been termed ‘before its time’ because the inventor did not see how to build a transition from what was known and in use to what was new.\n\n3 main goals of HCI\n1.

Lighting conditions\n2. Scene geometry\n3. Surface properties\n4. Camera optics\n5.

Compression -\u003e final RGB image (non-linear, 8-bit)\n\n### Examples\n#### Reflection\nSurface reflection depends on viewing $(\\theta_v,\\phi_v)$ and illumination $(\\theta_i,\\phi_i)$ direction along with the Bidirectional Reflection Distribution Function: $BRDF(\\theta_v,\\phi_v,\\theta_i,\\phi_i) = \\frac{\\rho_d}{\\pi}$\n\nAll angles are spherical coordinates w.r.t. the normal line of the surface.\n\nA Lambertian (matte) surface is one which appears the same brightness from all directions. A mirror (specular) surface is one where all incident light is reflected in one direction $(\\theta_v,\\phi_v)=(\\theta_r,\\phi_r)$\n\n#### Cameras\n![Bare-sensor imaging](/thoughts/images/bare-sensor-imaging.png)*All scene points contribute to all sensor pixels*\n\nAs a result, the image is really blurry.\n\n![Pinhole camera](/thoughts/images/pinhole.png)*Pinhole camera*\n\nThe image here is flipped, but no longer blurry. Roughly, each scene point contributes to one sensor. Pinhole camera means you need to get the right size of pinhole. If the pinhole is too big, then many directions are averaged, blurring the image. If the pinhole is too small, then diffraction becomes a factor, also blurring the image.\n\nA few perspective 'tricks' arise out of the pinhole\n1. Size is inversely proportional to distance\n2. Parallel lines meet at a point (vanishing point on the horizon)\n\nSide note, pinhole cameras are really slow because only a small amount of light actually makes it through the pinhole. As a result, we have lenses\n\n#### Lenses\nThe role of a lens is to capture more light while preserving, as much as possible, the abstraction of an ideal pinhole camera, the thin lens equation\n\n$$\\frac{1}{z'} - \\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{1}{f}$$\n\nwhere $f$ is the focal point, $z'$ is the distance to the image plane, and $z$ is the distance to the object.\n\nFocal length can be thought of as the distance behind the lens where incoming rays parallel to the optical axis converge to a single point.\n\nDifferent effects can be explained using physics phenomena. Vignettes are simply light that reaches one lens but not the other in a compound lens. Chromatic aberration happens because the index of refraction depends on wavelength of the light so not all colours can be in equal focus.\n\nSimilarities with the human eye\n- pupil is analogous to the pinhole/aperture\n- retina is analogous to the film/digital sensor\n\n#### Weak Perspective\nOnly accurate when object is small/distant. Useful for recognition\n\n![Weak Perspective Equation](/thoughts/images/weak-perspective.png)*Weak Perspective Equation*\n\n#### Orthographic Projection\n\n![Orthographic Project](/thoughts/images/orthographic-projection.png)*Orthographic Projection*\n\n#### Perspective Projection\n\n![Perspective Projection](/thoughts/images/perspective-projection.png)*Perspective Projection*\n\n## Image as functions\n### Grayscale images\n2D function $I(x,y)$ where the domain is $(x,y) \\in ([1, width], [1, height])$ and the range is $I(x,y) \\in [0, 255] \\in \\mathbb{Z}$\n\n### Point Processing\nApply a single mathematical operation to each individual pixel\n\n## Linear Filters\nLet $I(x,y)$ be an $n \\times n$ digital image. Let $F(x,y)$ be the $m \\times m$ filter or kernel. For convenience, assume $m$ is odd and $m \u003c n$. Let $k = \\lfloor \\frac{m}{2} \\rfloor$, we call $k$ the half-width.\n\nFor a correlation, we then compute the new image $I'(x,y)$ as follows:\n$$I'(x,y) = \\sum_{j=-k}^k\\sum_{i=-k}^k F(i, j) I(x + i, y + j)$$\n\nFor a convolution, we then compute the new image $I'(x,y)$ as follows:\n$$I'(x,y) = \\sum_{j=-k}^k\\sum_{i=-k}^k F(i, j) I(x - i, y - j)$$\n\nA convolution is just the correlation with the filter rotated 180 degrees. We denote a convolution with the $\\otimes$ symbol.\n\nIn general,\n1. Correlation: measures similarity between two signals. In our case, this would mean similarity between a filter and an image patch it is being applied to\n2. Convolution: measures the effect one signal has on another signal\n\nEach pixel in the output image is a linear combination of the central pixel and its neighbouring pixels in the original image. This results in $m^2 \\times n^2$ computations. When $m \\approx n$, then this is a $\\mathcal{O}(n^4)$\n\nLow pass filters filter out high frequences, high pass filters filter out low frequencies.\n\n### Properties of Linear Filters\n1. Superposition: distributive law applies to convolution. Let $F_1$ and $F_2$ be digital filters. Then $$(F_1 + F_2) \\otimes I(x,y) = F_1 \\otimes I(x,y) + F_2 \\otimes I(x,y)$$\n2. Scaling. Let $F$ be a digital filter and let $k$ be a scalar. $$(kF) \\otimes I(x,y) = F \\otimes (kI(x,y)) = k(F \\otimes I(x,y))$$\n3. Shift invariance: output is local (doesn't depend on absolute position in image)\n\n**Characterization Theorem**: Any operation is linear if it satisfies both superposition and scaling. Any linear, shift-invariant operation can be expressed as a convolution.\n\n#### Properties of Convolution\n1. Associative. $G \\otimes (F \\otimes I(x,y)) = (G \\otimes F) \\otimes I(x,y)$\n2. Symmetric. $(G \\otimes F) \\otimes I(x,y) = (F \\otimes G) \\otimes I(x,y)$\n\nCorrelation, on the other hand, is generally not associative.\n\nFor 1D Gaussians, we note $G_{\\sigma_1}(x) \\otimes G_{\\sigma_2}(x) = G_{\\sqrt{\\sigma_1^2 + \\sigma_2^2}}(x)$. Convolving with $G_\\sigma(x) \\otimes G_\\sigma(x) = G_{\\sqrt 2 \\sigma}(x)$\n\n### Boundary Effects\n1. Ignore these locations: make the computation undefined for the outsize $k$ rows/columns\n2. Pad with zeroes: return zero whenever of value of $I$ is required at some position outside the image\n3. Assume periodicity: wrap image around\n4. Reflect border\n\n### Pillbox\nA 2D pillbox is rotationally invariant but not separable\n\n$$f(x,y) = \\frac{1}{\\pi r^2}\n\\begin{cases} \n  1 \u0026 \\textrm{if} x^2 + y^2 \\leq r^2 \\\\\n  0 \u0026 \\textrm{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nAn efficient implementation would represent a 2D box filter as the sum of a 2D pillbox and some \"extra corner bits\"\n\n### Gaussian Filters\n- Box filter doesn't apply well for lens defocus. A circular pillbox is a much better model for defocus\n- Gaussian is a good general smoothing model\n  - for phenomena\n  - whenever the CLT applies\n\nGaussian filters are rotationally invariant.\n\nWe get $G_\\sigma(x,y) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sigma^2}\\exp^{-\\frac{x^2+y^2}{2\\sigma^2}}$ where $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation\n\nFor a 3x3, we then need to quantize and truncate it, evaluating $G_\\sigma(x,y)$ wherever in the filter. Increasing $\\sigma$ means more blur. Problem with 3x3 is that it truncates too much of the distribution (does not sum up to one), this can cause unintentional darkening.\n\nIn general, the Gaussian filter should capture $\\pm3\\sigma$ for $\\sigma = 1$ which gives us a 7x7 filter.\n\n#### Efficiency\nAs both the 2D box filter and 2D Gaussian filter are separable, it can be implemented as two 1D convolutions which convolve each row and then each column separately.\n\nA 2D filter is separable if it can be expressed as an outer product of two 1D filters\n\nA seperable 2D Gaussian only does $2m$ multiplications at each pixel (one for each 1D filter). Considering the image has $n \\times n$ pixels, then this is a $2m \\times n^2$ multiplications. Assuming $m \\approx n$, this is $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$\n\n#### Fourier Transform\nThe basic building block of the fourier transform is the periodic function.\n\n$$Asin(\\omega x + \\phi)$$\n\nwhere $A$ is the amplitude, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency and $\\phi$ is the phase. Fourier's claim was that you could add enough of these to get any periodic signal!\n\n### The Convolution Theorem\nLet $i'(x,y) = f(x,y) \\otimes i(x,y)$ be the convolution.\n\nThen, $\\mathcal{I}'(w_x,w_y) = \\mathcal{F}(w_x,w_y)\\mathcal{I}(w_x,w_y)$ which is just a simple element-wise multiplication after applying a Fourier transform to each.\n\nAt the expense of two Fourier transforms and one inverse Fourier transform, convolution can be reduced to (complex) multiplication. This speeds up the cost of FFT/IFFT for the image and filter to $\\mathcal{O}(n^2\\log n)$ and $\\mathcal{O}(m^2\\log m)$ respectively, dropping the total cost of convolution to $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$\n\n### Convolution Sizing\nConvolving two filters of size $m \\times m$ and $n \\times n$ results in a filter of size\n\n$$(n + 2 \\lfloor \\frac m 2 \\rfloor) \\times (n + 2 \\lfloor \\frac m 2 \\rfloor)$$\n\nMore broadly for a set of $K$ filters of sizes $m_k \\times m_k$ the resulting filter will have size \n\n$$(m_1 + 2 \\sum_{k=2}^K \\lfloor \\frac{m_k}{2} \\rfloor) \\times (m_1 + 2 \\sum_{k=2}^K \\lfloor \\frac{m_k}{2} \\rfloor)$$\n\n## Non-linear filters\n- Median Filter (take the median value of the pixels under the filter), effective at reducing certain kinds of noise, such as impulse noise ('salt and pepper' noise or 'shot' noise)\n- Bilateral Filter (edge-preserving filter). Effectively smooths out the image but keeps the sharp edges, good for denoising. Weights of neighbour at a spacial offset $(x,y)$ from the center pixel $I(X,Y)$ given by a product $\\exp^{-\\frac{x^2+y^2}{2\\sigma_d^2}}\\exp^{-\\frac{(I(X+x, Y+y) - I(X,Y))^2}{2\\sigma_r^2}}$. We call the first half of the product the *domain kernel* (which is essentially a Gaussian) and the second half the *range kernel* (which depends on location in the image).\n- ReLU. $x$ for all $x \u003e 0$, $0$ otherwise.\n\n## Sampling\nImages are a discrete (read: sampled) representation of a continuous world.\n\nAn image suggests a 2D surface which can be grayscale or colour. We note that in the continuous case that \n\n$i(x,y)$ is a real-valued function of real spatial variables, $x$ and $y$. It is bounded above and below, meaning $0 \\leq i(x,y) \\leq M$ where $M$ is the maximum brightness. It is bounded in extent, meaning that $x$ and $y$ do not span the entirety of the reals.\n\nImages can also be considered a function of time. Then, we write $i(x,y,t)$ where $t$ is the temporal variable. We can also explicitly state the dependence of brightness on wavelength explicit, $i(x,y,t,\\lambda)$ where $\\lambda$ is a spectral variable.\n\nWe denote the discrete image with a capital I as $I(x,y)$. So when we go from continuous to discrete, how do we sample?\n- Point sampling is useful for theoretical development\n- Area-based sampling occurs in practice\n\nWe also quantize the brightness into a finite number of equivalence classes. These values are called gray-levels\n\n$$I(x,y) \\implies \\lfloor \\frac{i(x,y)}{M} (2^n - 1) + 0.5\\rfloor$$\n\nTypically, $n=8$ giving us $0 \\leq n \\leq 256$\n\nIs it possible to recover $i(x,y)$ from $I(x,y)$? In the case when the continuous is equal to the discrete, this is possible (e.g. a completely flat image). However, if there is a discontinuouty that doesn't fall at a precise integer, we cannot recover the original continuous image.\n\nA bandlimit is the maximum *spatial frequency* of an image. The audio equivalent of this is audio frequency, the upper limit of human hearing is about 20kHz which is the human hearing bandlimit.\n\nAliasing is the idea that we don't have have enough samples to properly reconstruct the original signal so we construct a lower frequency (fidelity) version.\n\nWe can reduce aliasing artifacts by doing\n1. Oversampling: sample more than you think you need and average\n2. Smoothing before sampling: reduce image frequency\n\nThis creates funky patterns on discrete images called moire patterns. This happens in film too (temporal aliasing), this is why wheels sometimes look like they go backwards.\n\nThe fundamental result (Sampling Theorem): For bandlimited signals, if you sample regularly at or above twice the maximum frequency (called the Nyquist Rate), then you can reconstruct the original signal exactly.\n\n- Oversampling: nothing bad happens! Just wasted bits.\n- Undersampling: things are missing and there are artifacts (things that shouldn't be there)\n\n### Shrinking Images\nWe can't shrink an image simply by taking every second pixel\n\nArtifacts will appear:\n1. Small phenomena can look bigger (moire patterns in checkerboards and striped shirts)\n2. Fast phenomena can look slower (wagon wheels rolling the wrong way)\n\nWe can sub-sample by using Gaussian pre-filtering (Gaussian blur first then throw away every other column/row).

The key idea is the 'indeterminate' state as to their ontological status.\n\nVācaspati does not doubt the correctness of the Nyāya argument for [philosophical realism](thoughts/philosophical%20realism.md) but more so its completeness. I have cognition of a white horse, not of 'white' and of 'horse'. Vācaspati argues that the sum is greater than the whole -- it is not sufficient that a description of its constituent elements ('this' and 'silver') entirely constitute the unitary object of cognition ('this is silver').\n\n## Cognition-Object relationship\nThe cognition-object relationship here refers to one about [representational](thoughts/representation.md) content.\n\nRepresentation, in this context, means a cognitive state of being 'of' or 'about' the object. Important to note that, in this translation, representation is neutral to theories of perception\n\nExample case where a cognition (thought) is a thought of a specific object\n1. Object gives content (visayatā) to a cognition in the sense it is the subject of the thought and therefore individuates/gives identity to/specifies that cognition\n2. The cognition is then a representation (visayitā) of the object\n\nThe form usually is 'this thing is a shell' which is in the form of $F\\alpha$ where\n- $\\alpha$ is the object ('this thing', dharmin, qualificand, thing being distinguished)\n- $F$ is what it is cognised as (the concept, content of thought, dharma, the distinguisher)\n- Akin to the [Twin Earth Argument](thoughts/Twin%20Earth%20Argument.md), \"this\" can refer to different things\n\t- Like variable naming in programming languages where unification would not unify two 'this' from different scopes\n\nOntologies are theories of objects -- a conception of what the world is made up of. Ontologies need to be *interpreted*\n\n## Erroneous Cognition\n- A cognition is valid if it discriminates between that object and all others.\n- Discrimination is correct identification.\n- Erroneous cognition occurs when the subject takes it to be true when it is not.\n- Sublation is the incidence of a later cognition that results in the realization of an earlier cognition being erroneous.\n\nEpistemic indistinguishability: there is no perceived difference between contents of distinct cognitions (i.e. confusing 'this is shell' with 'this is silver')\n\nLet us take the simple perceptual demonstrative judgement of the form 'this is a piece of silver'. This can clearly be a wrong judgement as the relevant object could be a piece of shell.\n\nWhat does an erroneous cognition say about its object (if anything at all)?\n\nWell, this states that object and concept must *both* exist. Even in mistaking the shell of the silver, both shell (instantiated as physical demonstrated object) and silver (instantiated as primary object of cognition) exist. TLDR; erroneous cognition required determinate objects in the determinate world.\n\nThe state of taking 'this' to be silver is not explained simply by explaining that 'this' and 'silver' occur in it. Take for example, the non-erroneous cognition 'this looks like silver' which contains both constituent elements but is epistemically different from the earlier erroneous claim of 'this is silver'.\n\nSo how does an erroneous cognition $G\\alpha$ arise?\n1. Suppose the subject knows when the distinguisher $G$ is valid\n2. $G$ is not necessarily true given the conditions at hand may not be as remembered compared to the conditions under which $G$-identification was last true (temporally different).\n3. It is true that $G\\beta$ where $\\beta$ is a piece of silver at some point in the past\n4. It is true that $\\alpha$ exists\n5. It is false that $G\\alpha$\n6. It is false that $\\alpha$ is perceived as $\\beta$\nThe erroneous cognition arises when the subject believes 5 and 6 to be true instead.\n\nThe question then becomes, what is the object $\\alpha$ that is being individuated here?\n\nFirst, let $F$ and $G$ be incompatible (read: mutually exclusive) qualifiers. That is, if $F\\alpha$ then $\\lnot G\\alpha$ and vice versa.\n\nAdvaitin makes two contradictory conclusions here\n1. Utilizes P1: asserting that an object exists requires there to be a cognition with that object as its content through *pramānas*. Concludes that $G\\alpha$ cannot exist.\n2. Utilizes P2: what doesn't exist must not be the content of any cognition as it is not experienced as all. Concludes that $G\\alpha$ exists.\n\nBoth P1 and P2 rely on relevant (and fairly uncontroversial principles) to come to contradictory results. This argument shows that there is no way of assigning status to $G\\alpha$ and thus indeterminant.","lastmodified":"2022-02-15T20:23:08.933480147Z","title":"Indeterminacy"},"/thoughts/information":{"content":"\u003e Information is a thing that conveys meaning about stuff, transmitted from one place to another.\n\n[Source: What is Library \u0026 Information Science? by *Stacks \u0026 Facts on YouTube*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfP7AjwIZI8)\n\nWe store, access, and organize information through [information systems](thoughts/information%20system.md).\n\nCharacteristics\n* Truthfulness: information is correct\n* Aboutness: tells us about something else\n* Thingness: information is a thing, although perhaps intangible\n\nThe study of information in and of itself is a research area too, through and the [Information Professions](thoughts/information%20professions.md)\n\n### Hierarchy\nIn informatics, there exists the concept of an Information Hierarchy, Knowledge Pyramid, or DIKW Hierarchy.\n\nData is transformed into Information, which is transformed into Knowledge, which is then transformed into Wisdom.\n\n\u003e Data is not god-like; it is not absolute truth.

We may have access to more of it, but it’s not obvious that this is better—just different.\n\n\u003e While technology has changed the volume, pace, and sources of information in our daily lives, it has not changed its essential power to shape our knowledge and our behavior in the world.\n\nInformation fuels discovery. It enables us to build off of each others work, and accomplish more than what a [single person could](posts/collaborative-thinking.md).\n\nInformation organizes us.

Tokenization (how do we turn text into tokens?). However, we need to be wary of edge cases like hyphenation, punctutation, abbreviations, numbers, etc.\n2. Stopword removal (removing words that occur very frequently but don't contribute very much to overall meaning of sentence). However, we need to be wary of creating new phrases that never existed and removal of entire phrases (e.g. 'to be or not to be')\n3. Conflation and stemming (recall enhancing technique that takes different forms of words and replaces them by a single form). Example stemmers include Porter and Krovetz stemmers (difference is that Krovetz is more conservative, only stems to words in a dictionary). However, this can reduce precision when stemming results in incorrect words.\n4. Term weights (which terms are the most important? One common approach is to use term frequency between documents -- sometimes called Document Frequency or DF. The larger the DF, the less useful it is to discriminate between two documents. Measure of importance then is the inverse document frequency.

There is no such book as 1984._)\"\n\n\"Indeed, Wikipedia suffers from vandalism, and over time, its sustaining community has developed tools and practices for dealing with it that didn’t exist when Wikipedia was created.

Like everything else, they lose in the universe's constant battle against entropy.\n\nAs Boyer (2016) argues, infrastructures possess a temporal persistence that “points deathward.” Oil refineries along the Texas Gulf Coast, for example, take part in a system of resource extraction that hastens climate change; at the same time, climate change threatens the continued functioning of these refineries, and oil companies have requested federal funds to protect their facilities from the destructive environmental phenomena that they have a hand in creating (Associated Press, 2018).\n\n- Cruel optimism: the experience of placing hope in an object that perpetually prevents the realization of that hope\n- Angry optimism: \"does not attempt to escape or control the dangers of the present or to return to the comforts of the past but instead looks forward to the possibilities of a time beyond these\"\n\nNot just maintenance, but rebuilding. In the context of infrastructure and collapse, cruel optimism is the belief that rebuilding is a way to heal. \"Breakdown might instead represent an opportunity to create futures that do not resemble the past.\"\n\nLifetime of an infrastructure doesn't just cover its functional lifespan. Many components to this:\n1. Service life (assuming ongoing maintenance, duration of functionality)\n\t1. Risk analysis and modelling is one way of calculating thius\n2. Material life (how long will it take for the material of the infrastructure itself to degrade and erode)\n\nIn fact, for the vast majority of infrastructures, the material life of an infrastructure will far outlast its service life (e.g. concrete aqueducts of the Romans almost 2000 years ago).\n\nRepair, they argue, is just an excuse for returning things to what they used to be rather than see it as a chance for change. Berlant's worry is that the repair of infrastructure merely reinstates a comfortable yet crisis producing past\n\nA new form of utopianism in science [fiction](thoughts/fiction.md): \"if present conditions lead inexorably to collapse, how can that collapse be used as a resource from which to build more equitable ways of life\"\n\n## Commons\n*The commons: Infrastructures for troubling times*\n\n\u003e The common usually refers to an orientation toward life and value unbound by concepts and divisions of property, and points to the world both as a finite resource that is running out and an inexhaustible fund of human consciousness or creativity\n\n*Sensus communis*: \"'common sense' is merely the bourgeois order of truth standing in for the universal, what Stoler calls ‘‘a folk [epistemology](thoughts/epistemology.md).’’\"","lastmodified":"2022-02-15T20:23:08.933480147Z","title":"Infrastructure"},"/thoughts/innovation":{"content":"Innovation: the word to hide the lack of substance.

If table is initially empty, will behave like a hub and broadcast\n\t3. Can start populating switch table based off of sender field from frames\n\t4. Quicker than a router for internal communication (though some routers have an Ethernet switch built in)\n3. Router - glue that ties networks together (network layer)\n\t1. Does NOT support broadcast\n\t2. Serves as a bridge between private home network and the network of the internet provider (which can reach the rest of the internet)\n\t3. Modern routers can also perform\n\t\t1. Network address translation (NAT)\n\t\t\t1. More devices than IP addresses! What do we do?\n\t\t\t2. Home router gets assigned an IP (public IP) by the ISP\n\t\t\t3. Devices connected on the local network are assigned a private IP address (usually starts with subnet mask 196.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x)\n\t\t\t4. Changes the private IP address to the public address of the router (as well as the port)\n\t\t\t5. Adds the mapping to the NAT forwarding table\n\t\t\t\t1. Entries correspond to private side (192.168.1.3:42301) to public side (12.13.14.15:24604)\n\t\t\t6. Does the inverse when it receives a packet\n\t\t2. Assigning IP addresses to hosts using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)\n\t\t\t1. Discovery, host looks for a DHCP server\n\t\t\t\t1. Sender is 0.0.0.0 port 68\n\t\t\t\t2. Receiver is 255.255.255.255 port 67 (this is the broadcast address!)\n\t\t\t3. Router responds with an offer valid for the next $n$ seconds\n\t\t\t\t1. This is broadcasted (255.255.255.255) as router does not know where receiver is\n\t\t\t4. Host responds with acceptance\n\t\t\t\t1. Broadcast which address picked\n\t\t\t5. Router responds OK\n\t\t\t\t1. ACK message, still broadcast\n\t\t3. Broadcast WiFi signal\n\n## Error Correction\n1. Parity Bit\n\t1. Even parity is 1 if number of 1s is odd\n\t2. Can detect odd number of bit flips\n3. 2D Parity Bit\n\t1. \n4. Checksum\n\t1. Assume data is a sequence of 16-bit integers\n\t2. Addition, 1's complement sum, carry out added back in\n\t3. Checksum is the 1's complement of the computed value\n\t4. Compare with the received data (if same, it is ok)\n\t\t1. Alternatively, compute the same function over the data and checksum\n5. Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)\n\t1. Parameterized by constants G and r\n\t2. r + 1 is the length of G (some power of 2)\n\t3. G is the generator (arbitrary bit pattern)\n\t4. Sender wants to send D\n\t\t1. Chooses r CRC bits, R such that \u003cD, R\u003e is exactly divisible by G (mod 2)\n\t5. Receiver knows G, divides \u003cD, R\u003e by G. If the remainder is non-zero an error is detected!\n\t6. Can detect all burst errors less than r+1 bits, and burst errors greater than r+1 with probability 1-0.5^r\n\n## Access Control\n1. Half-duplex - both sides can transmit, but only one at a time\n\t1. Carrier Sense Multiple Access\n\t\t1. Listen before sending, only send if no one else is\n\t2. Collision Detection\n\t\t1. While sending, listen to see if what you are sending is garbled\n\t\t2. If so, give up\n\t3. \"Try again later\" uses binary exponential backoff\n\t\t1. Random backoff between 0 and power of 2 (n increases each time)\n\t4. Turn-based access control\n\t\t1. Controlled by centralized party - polls everyone\n\t\t2. Controlled by centralized party - passes a token between senders\n2. Full-duplex - both sides can transmit at the same time without interference","lastmodified":"2022-02-15T20:23:08.933480147Z","title":"Internet Computing"},"/thoughts/interoperability":{"content":"\u003e Portability implies switching platforms, but true interoperability is platform-agnostic.\n\nI think interopability in the context of the web means being able to transparently understand and share data, agnostic of platform.

Anything that is useful for understanding a particular design, user needs, and user behaviour.\n- What does it mean to collect user data? What techniques can be used, and how useful and reliable is the data that is collected?\n\nFive Key Issues\n1. Settings Goals. Goals will influence the nature of data gathering sessions, the data gathering techniques to be used, and the analysis to be performed.\n2. Identifying Participants. Those who fit the profile of types of people from whom data can be gathered are called the study population. Types of sampling are as follows:\n  - Probability Sampling: simple random sampling or stratified sampling\n  - Nonprobability Sampling: convenience sampling or volunteer panels\n    - Convenience Sampling: sample includes those who were available rather than those specifically selected\n3. Relationship with Participants: informed consent with a clear and professional relationship between participant and researcher (however, informed consent is generally not required when gathering requirements data for commercial company where a contract usually exist between collector and provider)\n\nTriangulation: the investigation of a phenomenon from at least two different perspectives. This is mostly focused on verification and reliability of data rather than making up for the limitations of another type of methodology\n1. Triangulation of data: data is drawn from different sources at different times/places/people\n2. Investigator triangulation: different researchers (observers, interviewers, and so on) have been involved in collecting and interpreting the data\n3. Triangulation of theories: use of different theoretical frameworks through which to view data\n4. Methodological triangulation: employ different data gathering techniques\n\n## 3 Methods for Data Recording\n1. Notes + Photographs -\u003e least technical and most flexible way of recording data, but can be difficult to capture the right highlights.\n2. Audio + Photographs -\u003e less intrusive than video, allows observers to focus on the activity rather than on trying to capture every spoken word.\n3. Video -\u003e highest fidelity. Things to keep in mind: 1) whether to fix cam position or use a roving recorder 2) where to point the camera 3) understanding the imapct of the recording on the participants\n\n## Interviews\n\u003e A conversation with a purpose\n\nGood for exploring issues, learning more about tasks, and getting inside user's head.\n\nCriteria for good interview:\n    -   Before:\n        -   get questions right → should support goals, should be easy to understand/answer\n        -   be organized → check equipment, have necessary docs\n        -   run pilots\n    -   During:\n        -   structure time\n        -   give participants context\n        -   use props and visuals → easier to show than tell\n    -   Listen well throughout!\n\n1. Open-ended/unstructured -\u003e exploratory and similar to conversation. Can be time-consuming but can also produce rich insights\n2. Semi-structured -\u003e plans basic script with both closed and open questions but probes interviewee until no new relevants info is there\n3. Structured -\u003e predetermined questions like a questionnaire, study is standardized (same questions with each participant)\n4. Group interviews -\u003e 3-10 people selected to provide a representative sample of the target population. Useful for investigating shared issues rather than individual experiences\n\nAsking questions like \"Can you tell me a bit more about...\" is called probing\n\n### Planning\nWhen developing Interview Questions, keep in mind open questions are best suited where the goal of the session is exploratory; closed questions are best suited where the possible answers are known in advance. Break long or compound questions into separate questions\n\nA lot of decisions to make:\n- Choosing a framework\n- Level of participation to adopt\n- How to make a record of the data\n- How to gain acceptance into the group being studied\n- How to ensure that the study uses difference perspectives\n\nEthnography: the description of the customs of people and cultures.

A core perspective or mission. That could be advocating for a certain perspective, aesthetic, region, idea, or about solving a problem and changing the world.\n2.  A principle (or group of principles) curating the output. Labels are ultimately trying to communicate an idea, incrementally, with each release. That means they need a consistent vision to successfully put an idea in the mind of the public. This means a level of creative leadership is required to curate what releases and artists are invited to be a part of the project.\n3.  Discrete releases. A label exists to put culture into the world, whether that’s music, ideas, a way of living, words, or something else. What makes a label unique from a person’s personal creative practice is that different people are invited to release work under the same banner. By constructing an umbrella under which multiple artists can sit, the label can generate more dialogue and “heat” because disparate nodes in the network are reflecting back similar ideals. What makes a label unique from a brand is that all of a brand’s efforts result in the promotion of a single product. In the case of a label, its efforts are always promoting different products that all relate to the same core aesthetics or ideals. \n4.  Information architecture. Record labels use catalogue numbers to sequence their releases. A similar sequencing or contextualizing of works is a key element of the label. It helps clue t he audience into the larger context of the work. This is already common in the new worlds of drop commerce and Web3, where concepts like “Seasons” have become used to conceptually organize content and community, bringing the language of fashion and television into broader cultural creation. This mixing is a hallmark of meta labeling.\n5.  A scene it participates in. Labels are at their best when they represent or are in dialogue with a thriving, organic scene or community. To truly be valuable, it must create value for the larger scene it’s a member of.\n6. A source of funding. Without funds to put into projects, any label is limited in its output. Previous labels used sales from their products to fund new releases, or someone’s existing personal wealth.

In the narrow sense, AI is concerned with extending the capacity of machines to perform functions that would be considered intelligent if performed by people. Its goal is to construct machines, and, in doing so, it can be thought of as a branch of advanced engineering... In order to make a machine capable of learning, we have to probe deeply into the nature of learning. And from this kind of research comes the broader definition of artificial intelligence: that of cognitive science.\n\n\"The question to ask about the program is not whether it is right of wrong, but if it is fixable.

Once upon a time, scientists determined to understand how birds fly. First they watched them, hoping to correlate the motion of a bird's wings with its upward movement.

Having thus determined that feathers were the organ of flight, the scientists then focused their efforts on microscopic and ultramicroscopic investigation of feathers in order to discover the nature of their flight-giving power.\n\n\"You have no reason to suppose that airplanes and birds work the same way -- birds have no propellors, airplanes have no feathers\"\n\n\"If we had to base our opinions on observation of how poorly children learned French in American schools, we would have to conclude that most people were incapable of mastering it.

[Consensus](thoughts/consensus.md) takes a long time. Decentralized methods are hard to get right. Is the tradeoff worth it? At what point do we trade good user experience with rights of data ownership?\n\n## Money and Speech\n\n\u003e Free as in beer or free as in speech? -- Richard Stallman\n\nFreedom of speech means that our *ability to speak* is free, but that doesn't mean we can say whatever we want (e.g. hate speech and defamation).\n\nSimilarly for [web3](thoughts/web3.md), access to the network is unrestricted (you only need a connection), but saying anything meaningful (e.g. state changing on the shared public record) has an associated cost. Thus certain behaviours we agree to be malicious (like creating fake transactions) are not disallowed, but just economically unsustainable.\n\nWouldn't this favour the rich? Well yes, but we can mitigate this by using weighting like [quadratic voting/funding](thoughts/quadratic%20funding.md) which values number of unique contributions more than dollar amounts.\n\n### Taxes\nLaffer curve: as the tax rate increases, the rate at which revenue increases slows down due to increased avoidance, evasion, and disincentive to engage in the taxed activity.\n\nThis can be applied to the rise and fall of empires: \"governments that overburdened their taxpayers, such as the Soviet Union and later Roman Empire, ended up on the dust-heap of history, while governments that collected below the optimum were often conquered by their better-funded neighbors.\"\n\n(Although, might not be [100% valid](https://qz.com/895785/laffer-curve-everything-trump-and-republicans-get-wrong-about-trickle-down-economics-and-reaganomics/amp/))\n\n### Dispute Resolution\n\u003e Most pre-modern cultures, ranging from the Iriquois in America to the pre-Christian Germanic peoples, decided that payment was better than punishment\n\nCurious if the main reason is that you need to keep track of whether someone has served their punishment or not and memory historically has been unreliable. On the contrary, you don't need to remember whether you were paid because you can just count your money.\n\nThe question applied to [web3](thoughts/web3.md): **can we advance the aims of rehabilitative justice using a shared and common historical record for better [accountability](thoughts/accountability.md)?**\n\n## Engineering Money\n\u003e Money-as-a-protocol really allows us to do is program incentives at scales never before possible\n\nMoney, in this context, is not a concrete thing, its an abstraction to communicative values, as a language, and as a technology. It is a classifier for things that exhibit behaviour that lets us use it for\n1. Store of Value\n2. Medium of Exchange\n3. Unit of Account\n\nMore importantly, there are tradeoffs in the above properties.\nGold is a great store of value but sucks as a medium of exchange (interesting tangent, the traditional heuristic that money *should* have inherent intrinsic value which is separate from the money but the truth is almost the opposite. If the medium used to express transactional relationship has its own value, its not a very functional abstraction).\n\nHistorically, like physical materials, we've just accepted properties the way they are and just built what we could with them. However, also like physical materials, we've found ways to engineer the fundamental properties that we want.\n\nHowever, it feels liek we run into a weird [catch 22](thoughts/catch%2022.md) here where it is debatable whether the new 'engineered money' actually does have the properties we claim to have so it holds us back from developing/accepting it any more. I think this is in large part due to money being a combination of both **technical protocols and [social contracts](thoughts/social%20contracts.md)**\n \nAndreas' argument is that we can use abstract monetary protocols which we can engineer to change gradually higher-order social contracts.","lastmodified":"2022-02-15T20:23:08.937480179Z","title":"Money"},"/thoughts/move-fast-and-break-things":{"content":"\u003e To slow down is to end up [default dead](http://www.paulgraham.com/aord.html); the rhythm and pace of how technology is supposed to be built does not allow for consideration of social consequences.

This process is essentially finding the cosine similarity between template and local image neighbourhood\n\n$$\\cos\\theta = \\frac{a \\cdot b}{|a||b|} = \\frac{a \\cdot b}{\\sqrt{(a \\cdot a)(b \\cdot b)}} = \\frac{a}{|a|} \\frac{b}{|b|}$$\n\nThen, we can map over the image and create a correlation map.

This is equivalent to a convolution $F$ is a $1 \\times 2$ filter with the first element is $-1$ and the second element is $1$. Note that the derivatives go up for the Y direction and the right for the X direction.\n\nWe usually smooth the image prior to derivative estimation. Increased smoothing\n- eliminates noise edges\n- makes edges smoother and thicker\n- removes fine detail\n\nWeights of a filter for differentiation should sum to 0 as a constant image should have derivative 0.\n\n### Edge Detection\nThe goal here is to identify sudden changes in image brightness as this encodes the vast majority of shape information.\n\nAn edge is a location with high gradient.\n\nMainly caused by\n- Depth discontinuity\n- Surface orientation discontinuity\n- Reflectance discontinuity (e.g. change in material)\n- Illumination discontinuity (e.g. shadows)\n\nAs we usually smooth prior to derivative calculation and convolution is associative, we can combine both steps and use derivatives of Gaussian filters.\n\n$$D \\otimes (G \\otimes I(X,Y)) = (D \\otimes G) \\otimes I(X,Y)$$\n\n#### Sobel (Gradient Magnitude)\nLet $I(X,Y)$ be an image. Then, we let $I_x(X,Y)$ and $I_y(X,Y)$ be estimates of the partial derivatives in the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively. Then, the vector $[I_x, I_y]$ or $\\nabla f = [\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}]$ is the gradient and $\\sqrt{I_x^2+I_y^2}$ is the gradient magnitude.\n\nThe gradient points in the direction of most rapid increase of intensity. The direction is then $\\theta = \\arctan{\\frac{\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}}{\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}}}$. The strength of the edge is then the magnitude $||\\nabla f|| = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}^2 + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}^2}$.\n\n#### Marr/Hildreth (Laplacian of Gaussian)\n**Design Criteria**\n1. localization of space (find where the edge is)\n2. localization in frequency (identify high frequency and low frequency edges)\n3. rotationally invariant (rotation shouldn't affect edges)\n\nFind the zero-crossings (intercepts) of the Laplacian of the Gaussian.

In images, we select the maximum point across the width of the edge (following the direction of the gradient).\n \n\tIn implementations, the value at a pixel $q$ must be larger than its interpolated values at $p$ (the next pixel in the direction of the gradient) and $r$ (the previous pixel in the direction of the gradient).

Linking and thresholding\n\tTrying to fix broken edge chains by linking separate edge pixels through taking the normal of the gradient and linking it if the nearest interpolated pixel is also an edge pixel. Accept all edges over low threshold that are connect to an edge over high threshold.\n\t\n|Author|Approach|Detection|Localization|Single Resp|Limitations|\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n|Sobel|Gradient Magnitude Threshold|Good|Poor|Poor|Thick edges|\n|Marr/Hildreth|Zero-crossings of 2nd Derivative|Good|Good|Good|Smooths Corners\n|Canny|Local extrema of 1st Derivative|Best|Good|Good||\n\n### Boundary Detection\nHow closely do image edges correspond to boundaries that humans perceive to be salient or significant? \n\nOne approach is using circular windows of radii $r$ at each pixel $(x,y)$ cut in half by a line that bisects the circle in half. Then, compare visual features on both sides of the cut and if the features are statistically different, then the cut line probably corresponds to a boundary.\n\nFor statistical significance:\n1. Compute non-parametric distribution (histogram) for left side\n2. Compute non-parametric distribution (histogram) for right side\n3. Compare two histograms, on left and right side, using statistical test\n\nExample features include\n- Raw Intensity\n- Orientation Energy\n- Brightness Gradient\n- Color Gradient\n- Texture gradient\n\nFor this implementation, we consider 8 discrete orientations ($\\theta$) and 3 scales ($r$)\n\n### Features\nCorners are locally distinct 2D image features that (hopefully) correspond to a distinct position on a 3D object of interest in the scene.\n\nCannot be an edge as estimation of a location along an edge is close to impossible (the aperture problem)\n\n### Autocorrelation\nCorrelation of the image (distribution of pixel values) with itself. At each pixel, compute its partial derivative w.r.t. either the $x$ or the $y$ axis, $I_y = \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial y}, I_x = \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial x}$.\n\nWindows on an edge will have autocorrelation that falls of slowly in the direction of the edge but rapidly orthogonal to the edgge. Windows on a corder will have autocorrelation that falls off rapidly in all directions.\n\n#### Harris Corner Detection\nAs a stats reminder, covariance is the *direction* of the correlation. The closer the covariance is to 1, the closer it is to a perfect positive correlation. -1 implies perfect negative correlation.\n\nWhen drawing distrubtion, draw normals to edges going from low values (dark) to high values (white).\n\n1. Compute image gradients over small region\n2. Compute covariance matrix ![Covariance Matrix](/thoughts/images/covmat.png) (essentially fitting a quadratic to the gradients over the small image patch $P$)\n4. Computer eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix.\n5. Use threshold on eigenvalues to detect corners ($\u003e0$ is a corner)\n\nWe can visualize the covariance matrix $C$ as an ellipse whose axis lengths are determined by the eigenvalues and orientation determined by $R$ (the rotation matrix). It tells us the dispersion of the gradients nearby.\n\nAs $C$ is symmetric, we have \n\n![Covariance matrix as ellipse equation](/thoughts/images/covellipse.png)\n\nWhere the minor axis is $\\lambda_{max}^{-1/2}$ and the major axis is $\\lambda_{min}^{-1/2}$\n\nThen, this is what the eigenvalues tell us:\n- Case 1 (both $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$ are close to zero): flat region\n- Case 2 ($\\lambda_2$ is much greater than $\\lambda_1$): horizontal edge\n- Case 3 ($\\lambda_1$ is much greater than $\\lambda_2$): vertical edge\n- Case 4 ($\\lambda_1$ are both rather large $\\lambda_2$): corner\n\nTo threshold, we can pick a function\n1. Harris \u0026 Stephens: $\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 - \\kappa (\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2)^2$ which is equivalent to $\\det(C) - \\kappa \\textrm{trace}^2(C)$. $\\kappa$ is usually 0.4 or 0.6.\n2.

Nobel: $\\frac{\\det(C)}{\\textrm{trace}(C)+\\epsilon}$\n\n#### Linear Algebra Aside/Review\nGiven a square matrix $A$, a scalar $\\lambda$ is called an **eigenvalue** of $A$ if there exists a nonzero vector $v$ that satisfies\n\n$$Av = \\lambda v$$\n\nThe vector $v$ is called an eigenvector for $A$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda$. The eigenvalues of $A$ are obtained by solving $\\det(A-\\lambda I) = 0$\n\n## Keypoint Description\n### Scale Invariant Features (SIFT)\nDavid Lowe\n\nInvariant to translation, rotation, scale, and other imaging parameters. (Generally works for about ~20% change in viewpoint angle)\n\nAdvantages:\n- Locality: features are local (robust to occlusion and clutter)\n- Distinctiveness: individual features can be matched to a large database of objects\n- Quantity: many features can be generated (even for small objects)\n- Efficiency: fast (close to real-time performance)\n\nDescribes both a **detector** and **descriptor**\n1.

Skimmable at different levels. Is there a 5s version? A 60s version?\n2. Transformable.

Data can be seen as 'elementary observations about properties of objects, events, and their environments'\n\nA set of resources is then transformed by an organizing system when the resources are described or arranged to enable interactions with them.\n\n### Tradeoffs\n\u003e The effectiveness of a system for accessing information is a direct function of the intelligence put into organizing it (Svenonius, 2000)\n\nThere are inherent tradeoffs in an organizing system, what is the goal?

We organize collections of resources using the properties that are easiest to perceive, or whose values vary the most among the items in the collection\n2. We group together resources that we often use together\n3.

In fact, a well-kept pile of papers can be more efficient than a linear index (very similar to the ethic of grab what you need and rely on internal organization than some explicit organizational system).

This incentivizes participation for actual gameplay loops + events\n\t- For example, when the game decides to host an event by boosting item drop rates for certain dungeons, people actually just play the game more rather than accumulating wealth and just buying the items off of farmers seeking to make a profit\n- However, this enables a secondary (illicit) market that trades *accounts* rather than items. This only accounts for a very small minority of trades as the average user does not use more than a single account\n- There is certain prestige that comes with owning certain items (e.g. \u003c1% drop rate from one of the most difficult dungeons in the game)\n\t- This is a visual signifier for one of three things: skill, veterancy, or dedication\n- As a result, organized groups for running hard and dangerous dungeons have emerged, with highly coordinated Discord servers with bots for managing headcount and role distribution (we need 2 healers! 5 people who can boost our damage!)\n\t- Some of the more elite groups actually have very strict requirements for entry (need to have 3 characters at the strongest stat cap, activity requirements, etc.)\n\t- All of these are volunteer run\n\nBy keeping the most prestigious items *untradeable*, it incentivizes more community involvement and recognition/prestige around the activities that yield those items. A lot of these items are extremely powerful and enable incredibly unique capabilities for characters.

In a fearful society; love and trust are the primary tools of resistance.\n\n[Source: *Kernel* on Trust](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-0/trust)\n\n\u003e Trust is only meaningful once we have fully understood how people can lie.\n\nHaving clearly defined and encoded rules means that there is an *implicit shift* from trusting those who own the medium to those who are transacting. In essense, trusting peers rather than a regulatory power.\n\nThis feels like its missing an important step in the process: trusting the medium. If people don't understand how the medium works to facilitate transactions, how can they trust it? Not only is **access** important, but how easily people understand why it works.\n\nCurious whether this has relations to [philosophy of science](thoughts/philosophy%20of%20science.md) and [Cartesian skepticism](thoughts/Descartes'%20Meditations.md)\n\nRelated: [game theory and trust](thoughts/game%20theory.md)\n\n\u003e To dream up important ideas you must think like an idealist; to build systems that will live up to those dreams, you must think like an adversary.\n\n### [Money](thoughts/money.md) as Faith\nWhat you believe informs what you pay attention to and how you act, which define what you vest value in.\n\n## Web3\n\"Because [blockchain](thoughts/blockchain.md)s allow us to define succinctly our shared truths, **and because the record itself is shared** across all participants, there is a whole new \"trust space\" we can explore, searching for more valuable kinds of transactions impossible within merely legal fictions.\"\n\n## Trust as an Unquestioning Attitude\n*C. Thi Nguyen*\n\n\"We inhabit trust like we inhabit the air, and we only notice it when it has departed.\"\n\n\u003e Most theories of trust presume that trust is a conscious attitude that can be directed at only other agents. I sketch a different form of trust: the unquestioning attitude. What it is to trust, in this sense, is not simply to rely on something, but to rely on it unquestioningly. It is to rely on a resource while suspending deliberation over its reliability\n\n### Baier's Goodwill Theory\nColloquial use of \"trust\" blurs together two very distinct concepts\n- Mere reliance: depending on something\n- Attitude of trust: depend in some more normatively loaded manner\n\t- E.g. failing to show up after having promised to do so: \"I had trusted you and you let me down\"\n\t- Generally applies to things/people within our integrative stance -- things we take to be part of us and towards things with which we are supposed to be integrating to form some larger whole\n\t- The normativity here arises, not from there being any moral commitments in play, but from teleological integration: \"The external objects that evoke the strongest sense of betrayal are those whose functions are most tightly integrated into our own thinking and functioning\"\n\nQuestion: can objects be trusted in the normative sense? Can we feel betrayed by objects?\n\nThis involves ascribing goodwill to the trusted and the sense of betrayal comes from discovery that there is no such goodwill after all.\n\n### Responsiveness Theories\nThinking that the fact that you trust in them/it will give a reason to fulfill that trust.\n\n\u003e a trustworthy person “takes the fact that they are counted on to be a reason for acting as counted on” (Jones 2012, 66)\n\nBetrayal of trust here is failure to be properly responsive\n\nHawley's definition of trust is that \"to trust somebody is to take them to have made a commitment to do something and to rely on them to fulfill that commitment. Hawley's account grounds the sence of betrayal in the trusted person's failure to live up to their commitments\"\n\n### Non-agent based theories\nYet all of these theories share the presumption of agent-directedness or [intentionality](thoughts/intentionality.md).\n\nRelated, [agential gullibility and the Extended mind Hypothesis](thoughts/Extended%20Mind%20Hypothesis.md)\n\n\u003e \"The veteran also suffers from a problem of trust, a building block on which all of social life is erected. The everyday, taken-for-granted reality of civilian life ignores much; civility assumes the nonlethal intentions of others. In war, however, all such assumptions evaporate: one cannot trust the ground one walks on, the air one breathes, nor can one expect with full assuredness that tomorrow will come again.\" (Kearl 1989, 353)\n\u003e ...\n\u003e The fact that many philosophers find it odd to speak of being betrayed by their environment is perhaps best explained by the fact that most philosophers have lead, by and large, pretty cushy lives.\n\nInteresting to distinguish between what we are trusting when we trust designed (e.g. search engines, devices, websites, etc.) and non-designed objects (the ground, physics, etc.)\n\nTo lose trust is to shift from the unquestioning state to the endlessly skeptical and suspicious mood.\n\nPHIL 240A Assignment 1: [Trust as Unquestioning Attitude](thoughts/Trust%20as%20Unquestioning%20Attitude.md)","lastmodified":"2022-02-15T20:23:08.937480179Z","title":"Trust"},"/thoughts/truth":{"content":"Is there a hard truth to anything in the universe?

Early focus on users and tasks: Understanding who users will be (cognitive, behavioural, anthropomorphic, and attitudinal characteristics) and observing users doing normal tasks, studying nature of normal tasks, involving users in design process.\n2. Empirical measurement: early in development, get reactions and performance of intended users to scenarios/manuals/etc. Then, later in development, get reactions and performance of users to simulations and prototypes. Where possible, specific usability and UX goals should be identified, clearly documented and agreed upon at the beginning of the project which can help designers choose between alternative designs and check on progress.\n3. Iterative design: when problems are found in user testing, they are fixed, then more tests and observations carried out to see effects of fixes. This allows the design to be refined based on feedback\n\nBenefits:\n1. Expectation management: ensuring that the users' expectations of the new product are realistic and no surprises for users when the product arrives.\n2.

Develops could generally rest assured that these protocols wouldn't change much because they were commonly agreed on by the community. \n\n### Web2, Platform Economy [2000s to 2020s]\nInternet as we know it today, companies that provide services in exchange for your personal data. Web2 enabled us to enjoy P2P interactions on a global scale, but always with a middleman: a platform acting as a trusted intermediary between two people who do not know or trust each other.\n\nGeneral migration from open services to more sophisticated, centralized services\n\nEffects include frequent incursions on personal privacy, the spread of misinformation, and the ‘attention economy,’ all of which have fundamentally changed how we relate to one another, and destabilized civic engagement and labor across industries. [Source](https://gitcoin.co/blog/seeking-a-new-kind-of-public-good/)\n\n### Web3, Token Economy [2020s to present]\nDecentralized apps (usually running on the blockchain).\n\nMajor benefits:\n1. Anyone on the network can use the service (no one can block/deny you access to the service)\n2. Payments are built in (ether or ETH)\n3. Turing complete\n4. Require no personal data\n5. High reliability: runs on decentralized network rather than a single backend\n\nLimitations\n1. Scalability/Speed: change to state need to be processed and propagated\n2. UX: lots of information, not a lot of good ways to interface with it\n3. Fracturability: can happen when there are disagreements about protocol changes\n4. Cost: gas fees \n\nVerifiability is the atom of web3. It is what the hyperlink was for Web1.\n\n## Cool Applications\n### [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/)\nHow do we incentivize [open source software](posts/paid-open-source.md)? Gitcoin approaches this through decentralizing [funding](thoughts/funding.md) (away from corporations and toward individuals).\n\nNot just providing funding, 4 main value adds\n1. Earn -\u003e get paid to do maintenance work and upkeep of public goods!\n2. Learn -\u003e mentorship from industry leaders and peers\n3. Connect -\u003e creating a community of builders and support network\n4. Fund -\u003e making it easy for developers to support each other\n\n### [Golem](https://blog.golemproject.net/golem-primer/)\n\nTLDR: Golem democratizes society’s access to computing power by creating a decentralized platform where anyone can build a variety of applications, request computational resources and/or offer their idle systems in exchange for cryptocurrency tokens\n\n\u003eFrom large universities to scientists or artists, anyone can leverage the world’s unused computing power to conduct data intensive research and complex computations through the Golem Network","lastmodified":"2022-02-15T20:23:08.941480211Z","title":"Web3"},"/thoughts/web3-critique":{"content":"Really good piece by [Moxie on web3](https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html?curius=1294).\n\n- Web3 lacks [infrastructure](thoughts/infrastructure.md)\n\t- By definition, infrastructure does not need to be rebuilt every time they are used. To ask people to throw away their infrastructure is rather stupid.\n\t- Servers are infrastructure! Nodes are infrastructure! People won't want to run these themselves. Until we reach a point where enough web3 platforms are able to provide this same level of infrastructure, we're going to still end up with centralization.\n\t- \"If there’s one thing I hope we’ve learned about the world, it’s that people do not want to run their own servers. The companies that emerged offering to do that for you instead were successful, and the companies that iterated on new functionality based on what is possible with those networks were even more successful.\"\n- [Decentralization](thoughts/decentralization.md) is not always good. The more I get involved with the space, the more I am certain that the main value add of [blockchain](thoughts/blockchain.md) and [web3](thoughts/web3.md) is not decentralization but rather [interoperability](thoughts/interoperability.md) and [transparency](thoughts/transparency.md).\n\t- Decentralization also ends up making progress very difficult. See: [Vanilla Ice Cream effect](thoughts/Vanilla%20Ice%20Cream%20effect.md)\n\t- \"This isn’t a funding issue. If something is truly decentralized, it becomes very difficult to change, and often remains stuck in time.\"\n- Blind [trust](thoughts/trust.md). Crypto folks don't necessarily trust the people but some just blindly trust the medium. If people don't understand how the medium works to facilitate transactions, how can they trust it? Transparency also involves transparency into its inner workings.\n\t- Similarly, \"Almost all dApps use either Infura or Alchemy in order to interact with the blockchain.\"\n\t- We just rely on these two pieces of critical (centralized!) pieces of infrastructure to produce the correct results and not be bad actors.\n- [Degraded Blockchain problem](thoughts/Degraded%20Blockchain%20problem.md)\n\n### Vitalik Response\n[Source: Vitalki's Reddit Response](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ryk3it/my_first_impressions_of_web3/hrrz15r/)\n\nLevels of connecting to the blockcahin\n1.  Use a Binance account.\n2.  Run a piece of code that asks the Infura API endpoint what the blockchain state is, trust the answer. However, keys are still kept locally; the code signs transactions locally and sends them to the Infura API endpoint to be re-broadcasted.\n3.  Same as (2), but the code also runs a [light client](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/altair/sync-protocol.md) to verify the signatures on the block headers and uses Merkle proofs to verify individual account and storage data.\n4.  Same as (3), but the code talks to N different API endpoints run by N different companies, so only 1 of them need to be providing honest answers for the connection to be reliable.\n5.  Same as (4), but instead of pre-specifying N API endpoints the code connects directly to a p2p network\n6.  Same as (5), but the code also does data availability sampling and accepts fraud proofs, so it can detect and refuse to accept blocks that are invalid.\n7.  Run a fully verifying node.\n8.
