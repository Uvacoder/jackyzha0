      <description>Causality  When $a \rightarrow b$ then $a$ might have caused $b$  We say event $a$ happens before event $b$ ($a \rightarrow b$) iff:  $a$ and $b$ occurred at the same node, and $a$ occurred before $b$ in that node&amp;rsquo;s local execution order $a$ is the sending of some message $m$ and $b$ is the receipt of that same message $m$ (assuming sent messages are unique) there exists some $c$ such that $a \rightarrow c$ and $c \rightarrow b$      Concurrency  When $a \parallel b$ then $a$ cannot have cause $b$ (and vice versa)  Concurrent does not mean simultaneous, it means two things did not know about each other when they occurred (a is concurrent with b is written as $a \parallel b$)    Causal Order  $\prec$ is a causal order, it is consistent with causality, a strict total order on events  </description>

      <description>As it pertains to epistemic authority
Debates from Classical South Asia  Right and wrong aren’t directly perceptible to humans But some traditions in CSA say yes: revelation/sacred texts The source must be āpta with regard to what’s right and wrong; must have:  perfect knowledge of right and wrong the ability to communicate this knowledge at least lack the intention to lie, if not have the intention to communicate honestly   Vedas are author-less so can have no faults or biases &amp;ndash; uniquely trustworthy Dharmakīrti against authority of the Vedas  Even if there was a flawless revealed source, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t help as the the revealed source still has to be interpreted and this necessarily happens through human interactions mediated by language   Partiality makes communication possible, words are meaning-laden (see: terminology) because of conventions and usage  No one, then, can know the meaning of an &amp;lsquo;authorless&amp;rsquo; word: &amp;ldquo;it is not possible in the case of words that lack an [original] expounder&amp;rdquo; Common usage is partial and not an independent source of knowledge &amp;ldquo;Since the meaning of authorless words [can] be known neither from tradition, nor from reason, nor from the [ordinary] world, it is [only] proper [to say] that there is no cognition [of the meaning] in this case&amp;rdquo; See also: derived intentionality   Cannot trust other humans who are also flawed  &amp;ldquo;Indeed, a blind [person] does not find the way when led by [another] blind [person]!</description>

      <description>Symbolic Representation  Dretske just kinda doesn&amp;rsquo;t agree w/ the pioneer 10 space probe plate lmao  symbols will not mean anything to any alien life we find it easy to understand because we have the context and we live on this planet   what sort of things can be representations  words/pictures/numbers/diagrams state of mind, can represent almost anything at all   what sort of things can be objects of representations  almost anything (physical objects, sentences, numbers, moods, feelings, emotions, non-existent things) pictures represent by resemblance → derivative intentionality  ‘resemblance theory of pictorial representation’, or the &amp;lsquo;resemblance theory&amp;rsquo;     X represents Y → suggests that representation is a relation between two things is there a basic type of representation underlying everything else?</description>

      <description>Convergence of CS and Philosophy  newell and simon claimed that both digital computers and the human mind could be understood as physical symbol systems  using strings of bits or streams of neuron pulses as symbols representing the external world (formal symbol manipulation)   intelligence (as claimed by newell and simon) required making the appropriate inference from these internal representations  &amp;ldquo;a physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means for general intelligent action&amp;rdquo;   turning rationalist philosophy into a research program  hobbes → reasoning was calculating descartes → mental representations leibniz → &amp;ldquo;universal characteristic&amp;rdquo; — a set of primitives in which all knowledge could be expresse kant → concepts are rules russell → logical atoms as the building blocks of reality    Symbolic AI as a degenerating research program  problem of representing significance and relevance → how do you transfer the learnings to the real world  Heidegger  values are just meaningless facts (hammer is for hammering), leaves out information defining the relation of hammers to nails and the rest of the environment (readiness-to-hand)   Commonsense knowledge problem → how do we represent &amp;lsquo;common sense&amp;rsquo; in a way that is accessible to AI systems that use natural language  problem isnt curating those facts, it&amp;rsquo;s knowing which facts are relevant in any given situations (the frame problem)  should be able to ignore something without having to figure out that it should ignore it   if the computer is running a representation of the current state of the world and something in the world chances, how does the program determine which of its represented facts can be assumed to have stayed the same, and which would have to be updated?</description>
