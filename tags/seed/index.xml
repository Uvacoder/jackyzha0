      <description>Symbolic Representation  Dretske just kinda doesn&amp;rsquo;t agree w/ the pioneer 10 space probe plate lmao  symbols will not mean anything to any alien life we find it easy to understand because we have the context and we live on this planet   what sort of things can be representations  words/pictures/numbers/diagrams state of mind, can represent almost anything at all   what sort of things can be objects of representations  almost anything (physical objects, sentences, numbers, moods, feelings, emotions, non-existent things) pictures represent by resemblance → derivative intentionality  ‘resemblance theory of pictorial representation’, or the &amp;lsquo;resemblance theory&amp;rsquo;     X represents Y → suggests that representation is a relation between two things is there a basic type of representation underlying everything else?</description>

      <description>Convergence of CS and Philosophy  newell and simon claimed that both digital computers and the human mind could be understood as physical symbol systems  using strings of bits or streams of neuron pulses as symbols representing the external world (formal symbol manipulation)   intelligence (as claimed by newell and simon) required making the appropriate inference from these internal representations  &amp;ldquo;a physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means for general intelligent action&amp;rdquo;   turning rationalist philosophy into a research program  hobbes → reasoning was calculating descartes → mental representations leibniz → &amp;ldquo;universal characteristic&amp;rdquo; — a set of primitives in which all knowledge could be expresse kant → concepts are rules russell → logical atoms as the building blocks of reality    Symbolic AI as a degenerating research program  problem of representing significance and relevance → how do you transfer the learnings to the real world  Heidegger  values are just meaningless facts (hammer is for hammering), leaves out information defining the relation of hammers to nails and the rest of the environment (readiness-to-hand)   Commonsense knowledge problem → how do we represent &amp;lsquo;common sense&amp;rsquo; in a way that is accessible to AI systems that use natural language  problem isnt curating those facts, it&amp;rsquo;s knowing which facts are relevant in any given situations (the frame problem )  should be able to ignore something without having to figure out that it should ignore it   if the computer is running a representation of the current state of the world and something in the world chances, how does the program determine which of its represented facts can be assumed to have stayed the same, and which would have to be updated?</description>
