      <description>Decision rules when the agent is ignorant of all probabilities
Background Points  No information about probabilities A value function on outcomes a&amp;amp;s where a is an act and s is a state Most of the rules respect dominance  Rules  Dominance  Weak Dominance: act $a$ is as good or better than $b$ for each possible state and there is at least one state where it is strictly better Strong Dominance: act $a$ is strictly better than $b$ for all possible states Principle:  Avoid dominated acts and prefer dominant acts Can only use dominance principle if states are independent of acts Gold standard, use this whenever possible     Maximin/Leximin  Find the minimum value of each act Choose the act with the least bad worst-case outcome Note: can violate dominance if there are rows with the same minimum Leximin can help resolves ties by removing the minimum value in case of ties.</description>
