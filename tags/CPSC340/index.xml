      <description>All optimization algorithms perform equally well when their performance is averaged across all possible problems.
 There is no &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; machine learning model.</description>

      <description>A simple program consisting of if-else decisions (decision stumps) based on the features.
 We can create a bunch of decision stumps and define a &amp;ldquo;score&amp;rdquo; for each possible rule.</description>

      <description>A lot of content summarized from Mark Schmidt&amp;rsquo;s notes on Linear Algebra
Notation Generally column major
 Scalar (1,1): $\alpha$ Column Vector (m, 1): $\begin{bmatrix}a_1 \ a_2 \end{bmatrix}$ Row Vector (1, n): $\begin{bmatrix}a_1 &amp;amp; a_2\end{bmatrix}$ Matrix (m, n): $\begin{bmatrix}a_{1,1} &amp;amp; a_{2,1} \ a_{1,2} &amp;amp; a_{2,2}\end{bmatrix}$  Operations Transpose $(A^T){ij} = (A){ji}$</description>

      <description>How do you &amp;ldquo;look&amp;rdquo; at features and high-dimensional examples?
 Summary statistics  Categorical Features  Frequencies Mode Quantiles   Numerical Features  Location  Mean Median Quantiles   Spread  Range Variance Interquartile ranges     Entropy: measured &amp;ldquo;randomness&amp;rdquo; of a set of variables where entropy is $- \Sigma_{c=1}^k p_c \log p_c$ and $p_c$ is the proportion of times you have value $c$, range from $[0, \log k]$  Low entropy means it is very predictable whereas high entropy means it is very unpredictable (roughly, spread) Normal distribution has the highest entropy    Not always representative!</description>

      <description>Input: take features of examples and corresponding labels as inputs Output: a model that can accurately predict the labels of new examples  Generally, the most successful machine learning technique (with the exception of games)</description>
