      <description>As it pertains to epistemic authority
Debates from Classical South Asia  Right and wrong aren’t directly perceptible to humans But some traditions in CSA say yes: revelation/sacred texts The source must be āpta with regard to what’s right and wrong; must have:  perfect knowledge of right and wrong the ability to communicate this knowledge at least lack the intention to lie, if not have the intention to communicate honestly   Vedas are author-less so can have no faults or biases &amp;ndash; uniquely trustworthy Dharmakīrti against authority of the Vedas  Even if there was a flawless revealed source, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t help as the the revealed source still has to be interpreted and this necessarily happens through human interactions mediated by language   Partiality makes communication possible, words are meaning-laden (see: terminology) because of conventions and usage  No one, then, can know the meaning of an &amp;lsquo;authorless&amp;rsquo; word: &amp;ldquo;it is not possible in the case of words that lack an [original] expounder&amp;rdquo; Common usage is partial and not an independent source of knowledge &amp;ldquo;Since the meaning of authorless words [can] be known neither from tradition, nor from reason, nor from the [ordinary] world, it is [only] proper [to say] that there is no cognition [of the meaning] in this case&amp;rdquo; See also: derived intentionality   Cannot trust other humans who are also flawed  &amp;ldquo;Indeed, a blind [person] does not find the way when led by [another] blind [person]!</description>
